#!Whether you're frustrated with current PC offerings (and their inflated prices) or are simply looking for a cool project to take on, building a computer from the ground up using off-the-shelf parts can offer significant advantages. In these pages, computer dudes Darrel Wayne Creacy and Carlito Vicencio outline those advantages and then show you how to build the computer of your dreams. The pair begins by explaining what components make up a PC and what you need to think about when selecting those components, before helping you determine your needs and suggesting various configurations to fit those uses. Breaking the process down into its simplest terms, the authors provide component lists for a number of different PC setups: for students, home users, multimedia/home-theater enthusiasts, high-end graphic/video/audio producers, and more. Using plain language and plenty of visual and instructional aids--photos, illustrations, diagrams, step-by-step directions, and more--the authors ensure that even someone (like you!) who knows nothing about technology can build the perfect PC! On a more personal note, the authors are donating a percentage of their income from this book to the Breast Cancer Research Foundationï¾to thank all the women in their lives who have supported them and battled the disease.

#!Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Neyman-Pearson lemma are two fundamental concepts in statistics. Both are about likelihood ratios: Kullback-Leibler divergence is the expected log-likelihood ratio, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma is about error rates of likelihood ratio tests. Exploring this connection gives another statistical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of the loss of power of the likelihood ratio test when the wrong distribution is used for one of the hypotheses. In this interpretation, the standard non-negativity property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is essentially a restatement of the optimal property of likelihood ratios established by the Neyman-Pearson lemma. The asymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence is overviewed in information geometry.

#!Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. Results: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis---TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. Availability: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

#!We consider a problem motivated by the desire to provide flexible, rate-based, quality of service guarantees for packets sent over input queued switches and switch networks. Our focus is solving a type of online traffic scheduling problem, whose input at each time step is a set of desired traffic rates through the switch network. These traffic rates in general cannot be exactly achieved since they assume arbitrarily small fractions of packets can be transmitted at each time step. The goal of the traffic scheduling problem is to closely approximate the given sequence of traffic rates by a sequence of transmissions in which only whole packets are sent. We prove worst-case bounds on the additional buffer use, which we call backlog, that results from using such an approximation.We first consider the N × N, input queued, crossbar switch. Our main result is an online packet-scheduling algorithm using no speedup that guarantees backlog at most (N+1)2/4 packets at each input port and each output port. Upper bounds on worst-case backlog have been proved for the case of constant fluid schedules, such as the N2-2N+2 bound of Chang, Chen, and Huang (INFOCOM, 2000). Our main result for the crossbar switch is the first, to our knowledge, to bound backlog in terms of switch size N for arbitrary, time-varying fluid schedules, without using speedup.Our main result for Banyan networks is an exact characterization of the speedup required to maintain bounded backlog, in terms of polytopes derived from the network topology.

#!The field of supply chain management has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years, both as a research area and as a practical discipline. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of product covering problems in 3-tier supply chain models, and present natural complete problems for the classes W[3] and W[4] in parameterized complexity theory. This seems the first group of natural complete problems for higher levels in the parameterized intractability hierarchy (i.e., the W-hierarchy), and the first precise complexity characterizations of certain optimization problems in the research of supply chain management. Our results also derive strong computational lower bounds and inapproximability for these optimization problems.

#!To simulate adaptive agents with abilities matching those of their real-world counterparts, a natural approach is to incorporate adaptation mechanisms such as classical conditioning into agent-based simulation. Existing models for adaptation mechanisms are usually based on quantitative methods such as DST. In contrast, agent-based simulation is usually based on qualitative, logical languages. To bridge this gap, this paper puts forward an integrative approach to simulate and analyse the conditioning process of an adaptive agent, which integrates quantitative and qualitative aspects within one temporal specification language. The approach comprises (1) simulation of adaptation mechanisms in an executable language, (2) automated analysis of dynamic properties against simulation traces, and (3) verification of representation relations for internal agent states against simulation traces. Furthermore, the approach addresses the issue of realism of intermediate states in a simulated conditioning process.

#!The polynomial classifier (PC) that takes the binomial terms of reduced subspace features as inputs has shown superior performance to multilayer neural networks in pattern classification. In this paper, we propose a class-specific feature polynomial classifier (CFPC) that extracts class-specific features from class-specific subspaces, unlike the ordinary PC that uses a class-independent subspace. The CFPC can be viewed as a hybrid of ordinary PC and projection distance method. The class-specific features better separate one class from the others, and the incorporation of class-specific projection distance further improves the separability. The connecting weights of CFPC are efficiently learned class-by-class to minimize the mean square error on training samples. To justify the promise of CFPC, we have conducted experiments of handwritten digit recognition and numeral string recognition on the NIST Special Database 19 (SD19). The digit recognition task was also benchmarked on two standard databases USPS and MNIST. The results show that the performance of CFPC is superior to that of ordinary PC, and is competitive with support vector classifiers (SVCs).

#!Desirability of an action, often referred to as utility or value, is determined by various factors, such as the probability and timing of expected reward. We investigated how performance of monkeys in an oculomotor serial reaction time task is influenced by multiple motivational factors. The animals produced a series of visually-guided eye movements, while the sequence of target locations and the location of the rewarded target were systematically manipulated. The results show that error rates as well as saccade latencies were consistently influenced by the number of remaining movements necessary to obtain a reward. In addition, when the animal produced multiple saccades before fixating a given target, the first saccade tended to be directed towards the rewarded location, suggesting that saccades to rewarded location and visual target might be programmed concurrently. These results show that monkeys can utilize information about the required sequence of movements to update their subjective values.

#!Computation of similarity between categorical data objects in unsupervised learning is an important data mining problem. We propose a method to compute distance between two attribute values of same attribute for unsupervised learning. This approach is based on the fact that similarity of two attribute values is dependent on their relationship with other attributes. Computational cost of this method is linear with respect to number of data objects in data set. To see the effectiveness of our proposed distance measure, we use proposed distance measure with K-mode clustering algorithm to cluster various categorical data sets. Significant improvement in clustering accuracy is observed as compared to clustering results obtained using traditional K-mode clustering algorithm.

#cTheory of Computing Systems
#index70
#!We study the problem of how resilient networks are to node faults. Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network can sustain and still contain a large (i.e., linear-sized) connected component with approximately the same expansion as the original fault-free network. We use a pruning technique that culls away those parts of the faulty network that have poor expansion. The faults may occur at random or be caused by an adversary. Our techniques apply in either case. In the adversarial setting we prove that for every network with expansion $\alpha,$ a large connected component with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for up to a constant times $\alpha \cdot n$ faults. We show this result is tight in the sense that every graph G of size n and uniform expansion $\alpha(\cdot)$ can be broken into components of size o(n) with $\omega(\alpha(n) \cdot n)$ faults. Unlike the adversarial case, the expansion of a graph gives a very weak bound on its resilience to random faults. While it is the case, as before, that there are networks of uniform expansion $\Omega(1/{\rm log}\, n)$ that are not resilient against a fault probability of a constant times $1/{\log}\, n,$ it is also observed that there are networks of uniform expansion $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ that are resilient against a constant fault probability. Thus, we introduce a different parameter, called the span of a graph, which gives us a more precise handle on the maximum fault probability. We use the span to show the first known results for the effect of random faults on the expansion of d-dimensional meshes.

#!The self-organization of particles in a two phase system in the coexistence region through a diffusive mechanism is known as Ostwald ripening. This phenomenon is an example of a multiscale problem in that the microscopic level interaction of the particles can greatly impact the macroscale or observable morphology of the system. Ostwald ripening is studied here through the use of a mesoscopic model which is a stochastic partial integrodifferential equation that is derived from a spin exchange Ising model. This model is studied through the use of recently developed and benchmarked spectral schemes for the simulation of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations. The typical cluster size is observed to grow like t1/3 over range of times with faster growth at later times. The results included here also demonstrate the effect of adjusting the interparticle interaction on the morphological evolution of the system at the macroscopic level.

#!Recently the declining costs of computer hardware, combined with the rapidly increasing costs of software systems have led to considerable discussion of computer organizations. When a computing system is viewed as a data structure, a control structure, and a processing structure designed to execute algorithms, it is reasonable to consider how this system can be optimized in both a hardware sense, and in the sense of reducing the total system software costs. A reasonable approach to greater efficiency is to design computer systems whose structure more closely resembles that of the higher level language in which the algorithms are to be expressed.

#*Three-Level Caching for Efficient Query Processing in Large Web Search Engines
#@Xiaohui Long,Torsten Suel

#cWorld Wide Web
#index86
#!Large web search engines have to answer thousands of queries per second with interactive response times. Due to the sizes of the data sets involved, often in the range of multiple terabytes, a single query may require the processing of hundreds of megabytes or more of index data. To keep up with this immense workload, large search engines employ clusters of hundreds or thousands of machines, and a number of techniques such as caching, index compression, and index and query pruning are used to improve scalability. In particular, two-level caching techniques cache results of repeated identical queries at the frontend, while index data for frequently used query terms are cached in each node at a lower level. We propose and evaluate a three-level caching scheme that adds an intermediate level of caching for additional performance gains. This intermediate level attempts to exploit frequently occurring pairs of terms by caching intersections or projections of the corresponding inverted lists. We propose and study several offline and online algorithms for the resulting weighted caching problem, which turns out to be surprisingly rich in structure. Our experimental evaluation based on a large web crawl and real search engine query log shows significant performance gains for the best schemes, both in isolation and in combination with the other caching levels. We also observe that a careful selection of cache admission and eviction policies is crucial for best overall performance.
