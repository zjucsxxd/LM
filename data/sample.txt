#!Whether you're frustrated with current PC offerings (and their inflated prices) or are simply looking for a cool project to take on, building a computer from the ground up using off-the-shelf parts can offer significant advantages. In these pages, computer dudes Darrel Wayne Creacy and Carlito Vicencio outline those advantages and then show you how to build the computer of your dreams. The pair begins by explaining what components make up a PC and what you need to think about when selecting those components, before helping you determine your needs and suggesting various configurations to fit those uses. Breaking the process down into its simplest terms, the authors provide component lists for a number of different PC setups: for students, home users, multimedia/home-theater enthusiasts, high-end graphic/video/audio producers, and more. Using plain language and plenty of visual and instructional aids--photos, illustrations, diagrams, step-by-step directions, and more--the authors ensure that even someone (like you!) who knows nothing about technology can build the perfect PC! On a more personal note, the authors are donating a percentage of their income from this book to the Breast Cancer Research Foundationï¾to thank all the women in their lives who have supported them and battled the disease.

#!Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Neyman-Pearson lemma are two fundamental concepts in statistics. Both are about likelihood ratios: Kullback-Leibler divergence is the expected log-likelihood ratio, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma is about error rates of likelihood ratio tests. Exploring this connection gives another statistical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of the loss of power of the likelihood ratio test when the wrong distribution is used for one of the hypotheses. In this interpretation, the standard non-negativity property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is essentially a restatement of the optimal property of likelihood ratios established by the Neyman-Pearson lemma. The asymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence is overviewed in information geometry.

#!Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. Results: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis---TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. Availability: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

#!We consider a problem motivated by the desire to provide flexible, rate-based, quality of service guarantees for packets sent over input queued switches and switch networks. Our focus is solving a type of online traffic scheduling problem, whose input at each time step is a set of desired traffic rates through the switch network. These traffic rates in general cannot be exactly achieved since they assume arbitrarily small fractions of packets can be transmitted at each time step. The goal of the traffic scheduling problem is to closely approximate the given sequence of traffic rates by a sequence of transmissions in which only whole packets are sent. We prove worst-case bounds on the additional buffer use, which we call backlog, that results from using such an approximation.We first consider the N × N, input queued, crossbar switch. Our main result is an online packet-scheduling algorithm using no speedup that guarantees backlog at most (N+1)2/4 packets at each input port and each output port. Upper bounds on worst-case backlog have been proved for the case of constant fluid schedules, such as the N2-2N+2 bound of Chang, Chen, and Huang (INFOCOM, 2000). Our main result for the crossbar switch is the first, to our knowledge, to bound backlog in terms of switch size N for arbitrary, time-varying fluid schedules, without using speedup.Our main result for Banyan networks is an exact characterization of the speedup required to maintain bounded backlog, in terms of polytopes derived from the network topology.

#!The field of supply chain management has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years, both as a research area and as a practical discipline. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of product covering problems in 3-tier supply chain models, and present natural complete problems for the classes W[3] and W[4] in parameterized complexity theory. This seems the first group of natural complete problems for higher levels in the parameterized intractability hierarchy (i.e., the W-hierarchy), and the first precise complexity characterizations of certain optimization problems in the research of supply chain management. Our results also derive strong computational lower bounds and inapproximability for these optimization problems.

#!To simulate adaptive agents with abilities matching those of their real-world counterparts, a natural approach is to incorporate adaptation mechanisms such as classical conditioning into agent-based simulation. Existing models for adaptation mechanisms are usually based on quantitative methods such as DST. In contrast, agent-based simulation is usually based on qualitative, logical languages. To bridge this gap, this paper puts forward an integrative approach to simulate and analyse the conditioning process of an adaptive agent, which integrates quantitative and qualitative aspects within one temporal specification language. The approach comprises (1) simulation of adaptation mechanisms in an executable language, (2) automated analysis of dynamic properties against simulation traces, and (3) verification of representation relations for internal agent states against simulation traces. Furthermore, the approach addresses the issue of realism of intermediate states in a simulated conditioning process.

#!The polynomial classifier (PC) that takes the binomial terms of reduced subspace features as inputs has shown superior performance to multilayer neural networks in pattern classification. In this paper, we propose a class-specific feature polynomial classifier (CFPC) that extracts class-specific features from class-specific subspaces, unlike the ordinary PC that uses a class-independent subspace. The CFPC can be viewed as a hybrid of ordinary PC and projection distance method. The class-specific features better separate one class from the others, and the incorporation of class-specific projection distance further improves the separability. The connecting weights of CFPC are efficiently learned class-by-class to minimize the mean square error on training samples. To justify the promise of CFPC, we have conducted experiments of handwritten digit recognition and numeral string recognition on the NIST Special Database 19 (SD19). The digit recognition task was also benchmarked on two standard databases USPS and MNIST. The results show that the performance of CFPC is superior to that of ordinary PC, and is competitive with support vector classifiers (SVCs).

#!Desirability of an action, often referred to as utility or value, is determined by various factors, such as the probability and timing of expected reward. We investigated how performance of monkeys in an oculomotor serial reaction time task is influenced by multiple motivational factors. The animals produced a series of visually-guided eye movements, while the sequence of target locations and the location of the rewarded target were systematically manipulated. The results show that error rates as well as saccade latencies were consistently influenced by the number of remaining movements necessary to obtain a reward. In addition, when the animal produced multiple saccades before fixating a given target, the first saccade tended to be directed towards the rewarded location, suggesting that saccades to rewarded location and visual target might be programmed concurrently. These results show that monkeys can utilize information about the required sequence of movements to update their subjective values.

#!Computation of similarity between categorical data objects in unsupervised learning is an important data mining problem. We propose a method to compute distance between two attribute values of same attribute for unsupervised learning. This approach is based on the fact that similarity of two attribute values is dependent on their relationship with other attributes. Computational cost of this method is linear with respect to number of data objects in data set. To see the effectiveness of our proposed distance measure, we use proposed distance measure with K-mode clustering algorithm to cluster various categorical data sets. Significant improvement in clustering accuracy is observed as compared to clustering results obtained using traditional K-mode clustering algorithm.

#t2006
#cTheory of Computing Systems
#index70
#!We study the problem of how resilient networks are to node faults. Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network can sustain and still contain a large (i.e., linear-sized) connected component with approximately the same expansion as the original fault-free network. We use a pruning technique that culls away those parts of the faulty network that have poor expansion. The faults may occur at random or be caused by an adversary. Our techniques apply in either case. In the adversarial setting we prove that for every network with expansion $\alpha,$ a large connected component with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for up to a constant times $\alpha \cdot n$ faults. We show this result is tight in the sense that every graph G of size n and uniform expansion $\alpha(\cdot)$ can be broken into components of size o(n) with $\omega(\alpha(n) \cdot n)$ faults. Unlike the adversarial case, the expansion of a graph gives a very weak bound on its resilience to random faults. While it is the case, as before, that there are networks of uniform expansion $\Omega(1/{\rm log}\, n)$ that are not resilient against a fault probability of a constant times $1/{\log}\, n,$ it is also observed that there are networks of uniform expansion $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ that are resilient against a constant fault probability. Thus, we introduce a different parameter, called the span of a graph, which gives us a more precise handle on the maximum fault probability. We use the span to show the first known results for the effect of random faults on the expansion of d-dimensional meshes.

#!The self-organization of particles in a two phase system in the coexistence region through a diffusive mechanism is known as Ostwald ripening. This phenomenon is an example of a multiscale problem in that the microscopic level interaction of the particles can greatly impact the macroscale or observable morphology of the system. Ostwald ripening is studied here through the use of a mesoscopic model which is a stochastic partial integrodifferential equation that is derived from a spin exchange Ising model. This model is studied through the use of recently developed and benchmarked spectral schemes for the simulation of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations. The typical cluster size is observed to grow like t1/3 over range of times with faster growth at later times. The results included here also demonstrate the effect of adjusting the interparticle interaction on the morphological evolution of the system at the macroscopic level.

#!Recently the declining costs of computer hardware, combined with the rapidly increasing costs of software systems have led to considerable discussion of computer organizations. When a computing system is viewed as a data structure, a control structure, and a processing structure designed to execute algorithms, it is reasonable to consider how this system can be optimized in both a hardware sense, and in the sense of reducing the total system software costs. A reasonable approach to greater efficiency is to design computer systems whose structure more closely resembles that of the higher level language in which the algorithms are to be expressed.

#*Three-Level Caching for Efficient Query Processing in Large Web Search Engines
#@Xiaohui Long,Torsten Suel
#t2006
#cWorld Wide Web
#index86
#!Large web search engines have to answer thousands of queries per second with interactive response times. Due to the sizes of the data sets involved, often in the range of multiple terabytes, a single query may require the processing of hundreds of megabytes or more of index data. To keep up with this immense workload, large search engines employ clusters of hundreds or thousands of machines, and a number of techniques such as caching, index compression, and index and query pruning are used to improve scalability. In particular, two-level caching techniques cache results of repeated identical queries at the frontend, while index data for frequently used query terms are cached in each node at a lower level. We propose and evaluate a three-level caching scheme that adds an intermediate level of caching for additional performance gains. This intermediate level attempts to exploit frequently occurring pairs of terms by caching intersections or projections of the corresponding inverted lists. We propose and study several offline and online algorithms for the resulting weighted caching problem, which turns out to be surprisingly rich in structure. Our experimental evaluation based on a large web crawl and real search engine query log shows significant performance gains for the best schemes, both in isolation and in combination with the other caching levels. We also observe that a careful selection of cache admission and eviction policies is crucial for best overall performance.

This practical, problem-solving guide is ideal if you're an engineer, programmer, or researcher writing an application for one of the legions of platforms on which C++ runs. The algorithms provided in C++ Cookbook will jump-start your development by giving you some basic building blocks that you don't have to develop on your own. Less a tutorial than a problem-solver, the book addresses many of the most common problems you're likely encounter--whether you've been programming in C++ for years or you're relatively new to the language. Here are just some of the time-consuming tasks this book contains practical solutions for: Reading the contents of a directory Creating a singleton class Date and time parsing/arithmetic String and text manipulation Working with files Parsing XML Using the standard containers Typical of O'Reilly's "Cookbook" series, C++ Cookbook is written in a straightforward format, featuring recipes that contain problem statements and code solutions, and apply not to hypothetical situations, but those that you're likely to encounter. A detailed explanation then follows each recipe in order to show you how and why the solution works. This question-solution-discussion format is a proven teaching method, as any fan of the "Cookbook" series can attest to. This book will move quickly to the top of your list of essential C++ references.

#!This paper presents an algorithm to model volumetric data and other one for non-rigid registration of such models using spheres formulated in the geometric algebra framework. The proposed algorithm for modeling, as opposite to the Union of Spheres method, reduces the number of entities (spheres) used to model 3D data. Our proposal is based in marching cubes idea using, however, spheres, while the Union of Spheres uses Delaunay tetrahedrization. The non-rigid registration is accomplished in a deterministic annealing scheme. At the preprocessing stage we segment the objects of interest by a segmentation method based on texture information. This method is embedded in a region growing scheme. As our final application, we present a scheme for surgical object tracking using again geometric algebra techniques.

Uses progressive enhancement techniques to ensure graceful degradation (which makes sites usable in all browsers). Shows readers how to write their own Ajax scripts instead of relying on third-party libraries.Web site designers love the idea of Ajax--of creating Web pages in which information can be updated without refreshing the entire page. But for those who aren't hard-core programmers, enhancing pages using Ajax can be a challenge. Even more of a challenge is making sure those pages work for all users. In Bulletproof Ajax, author Jeremy Keith demonstrates how developers comfortable with CSS and (X)HTML can build Ajax functionality without frameworks, using the ideas of graceful degradation and progressive enhancement to ensure that the pages work for all users. Throughout this step-by-step guide, his emphasis is on best practices with an approach to building Ajax pages called Hijax, which improves flexibility and avoids worst-case scenarios.

#!Browsing activities are an important source of information to build profiles of the user interests and personalize the human-computer interaction during information seeking tasks. Visited pages are easily collectible, e.g., from browsers' histories and toolbars, or desktop search tools, and they often contain documents related to the current user needs. Nevertheless, menus, advertisements or pages that cover multiple topics affect negatively the advantages of an implicit feedback technique that exploits these data to build and keep updated user profiles. This work describes a technique to collect text relevant to the current needs from sequences of pages visited by the user. The evaluation shows how it outperforms other techniques that consider the whole page contents. We also introduce an improvement based on machine learning techniques that is currently under evaluation.

#@Salem Benferhat,Didier Dubois,Souhila Kaci,Henri Prade

#cInformation Fusion
#index125
#!The bipolar view in preference modeling distinguishes between negative and positive preferences. Negative preferences correspond to what is rejected, considered unacceptable, while positive preferences correspond to what is desired. But what is tolerated (i.e., not rejected) is not necessarily desired. Both negative and positive preferences can be a matter of degree. Bipolar preferences can be represented in possibilistic logic by two separate sets of formulas: prioritized constraints, which describe what is more or less tolerated, and weighted positive preferences, expressing what is particularly desirable. The problem of merging multiple-agent preferences in this bipolar framework is then discussed. Negative and positive preferences are handled separately and are combined in distinct ways. Since negative and positive preferences are stated separately, they may be inconsistent, especially in this context of preference fusion. Consistency can be enforced by restricting what is desirable to what is tolerated. After merging, and once the bipolar consistency is restored, the set of preferred solutions can be logically characterized. Preferred solutions should have the highest possible degree of feasibility, and only constraints with low priority may have to be discarded in case of inconsistency inside negative preferences. Moreover, preferred solutions should satisfy important positive preferences when feasible (positive preferences may be also inconsistent). Two types of preferred solutions can be characterized, either in terms of a disjunctive combination of the weighted positive preferences, or in terms of a cardinality-based evaluation.

#cJournal of Computational Physics
#index127
#!The present paper describes the numerical technique that has been developed, in the framework of the particle-in-cell (PIC) method, to study the dynamics of a nonneutral plasma along the magnetic field lines. In particular, the technique has been employed to simulate the formation and long-term evolution of large-amplitude electrostatic waves experimentally observed in electron plasmas confined in a Penning trap [W. Bertsche, J. Fajans, L. Friedland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 (2003) 265003]. Due to the peculiar features of the physical system, namely the existence of different time scales and the presence of a perturbative oscillating potential, ad hoc numerical techniques have been developed. In particular, with a suitable radial decomposition all important two-dimensional phenomena are fully taken into account while keeping the computational effort to that of a standard one-dimensional PIC codes. Moreover, a novel particle loading technique (ergodic loading) has been developed, which ensures a significant reduction of numerical noise. The results obtained with the present technique are in excellent agreement with the experiments [F. Peinetti, W. Bertsche, J. Fajans, J. Wurtele, L. Friedland, Phys. Plasmas 12 (2005) 062112]. Moreover, results presented here furnish clear evidences of the close relationship between the observed nonlinear structures and the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes.

#!We introduce the logical story behind file input in ACL2 and discuss the types of theorems that can be proven about file-reading operations. We develop a low level library for reasoning about the primitive input routines. We then develop a representation for Unicode text, and implement efficient functions to translate our representation to and from the UTF-8 encoding scheme. We introduce an efficient function to read UTF-8-encoded files, and prove that when files are well formed, the function produces valid Unicode text which corresponds to the contents of the file.We find exhaustive testing to be a useful technique for proving many theorems in this work. We show how ACL2 can be directed to prove a theorem by exhaustive testing.

#!Finite difference approximations of the second derivative in space appearing in, parabolic, incompletely parabolic systems of, and 2nd-order hyperbolic, partial differential equations are considered. If the solution is pointwise bounded, we prove that finite difference approximations of those classes of equations can be closed with two orders less accuracy at the boundary without reducing the global order of accuracy.This result is generalised to initial-boundary value problems with an mth-order principal part. Then, the boundary accuracy can be lowered m orders.Further, it is shown that schemes using summation-by-parts operators that approximate second derivatives are pointwise bounded. Linear and nonlinear computations, including the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, corroborate the theoretical results.

#!In this paper we present a framework for scenarios in simulation games. It is used to support developing, using, and managing complex and dynamic simulation games, and it supports the achievement of the game's learning goal. Especially game facilitation is increasingly challenging due to the nature of these simulation games. The framework consists of a number of conditions, rules and actions, based on the concept of production systems from artificial intelligence, and it is presented as a component of Zeigler's experimental frame. This has been successfully used in the Distributor Game, which is the first of a series of management games developed for today's supply chain management challenges. Further research will focus on the extension of the set of conditions, rules and actions, and on visualizing and managing the interdependencies between the simulation game, its scenario, and the players.

#*Fusionplex: resolution of data inconsistencies in the integration of heterogeneous information sources
#@Amihai Motro,Philipp Anokhin
#t2006
#cInformation Fusion
#index169
#!Fusionplex is a system for integrating multiple heterogeneous and autonomous information sources that uses data fusion to resolve factual inconsistencies among the individual sources. To accomplish this, the system relies on source features, which are meta-data on the merits of each information source; for example, the recentness of the data, its accuracy, its availability, or its cost. The fusion process is controlled with several parameters: (1) with a vector of feature weights, each user defines an individual notion of data utility; (2) with thresholds of acceptance, users ensure minimal performance of their data, excluding from the fusion process data that are too old, too costly, or lacking in authority, or numeric data that are too high, too low, or obvious outliers; and, ultimately, (3) in naming a particular fusion function to be used for each attribute (for example, average, maximum, or simply any) users implement their own interpretation of fusion. Several simple extensions to SQL are all that is needed to allow users to state these resolution parameters, thus ensuring that the system is easy to use. Altogether, Fusionplex provides its users with powerful and flexible, yet simple, control over the fusion process. In addition, Fusionplex supports other critical integration requirements, such as information source heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the information environment, quick ad-hoc integration, and intermittent source availability. The methods described in this paper were implemented in a prototype system that provides complete Web-based integration services for remote clients.

#!This conference, organized jointly by the National Physical Laboratory and the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications, was a sequel to the one on unconstrained optimization held in January 1971. The intention was that the papers should all be expository in nature, providing a broad survey of fundamental and useful techniques. In spite of the extra constraints imposed by the Emergency Power Regulations (the proceedings of the first day being held in an atmosphere of increasing gloom due to the fact that lights were not permitted at N.P.L. that day) the aim of the Conference was achieved. The standard of the papers was unusually high and clearly much effort had been taken, both collectively and individually; one small, but useful, indication being the use of a common notation. The major criticism that could be leveled would be to do with the amount of material covered in some of the sessions making it a very intensive course indeed, and leading, perhaps, to some feeling of mental indigestion. Fortunately, pre- or post-prints of most of the talks were available or promised, and the complete proceedings are to be published.

#!This paper presents a new algorithm to produce a near optimal mixture of experts model (MEM) architecture for a continuous mapping. The MEM is applied to a new method incorporating photon scatter for designing compensators for intensity modulated radiation therapy. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm to partition data before training commences. A reduction in the size of training sets also allows the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to be implemented. As a result, both training time and validation error are reduced. A 71% reduction in prediction error compared with that of a single neural network is achieved.

#!In this paper we propose a traffic predictor based on multiresolution decomposition for the adaptive bandwidth control in locally controlled self-sizing networks. A selfsizing network can provide quantitative packet-level QoS to aggregate traffic by allocating link/switch capacity automatically and adaptively using online traffic data. In a locally controlled network such as Internet, resource allocation decisions are made at the node level. We show that wavelet based adaptive bandwidth control method performs better than other popular methods like Gaussian predictor for such applications. We have compared the performance of different ortho-normal wavelets and found that Haar wavelet is best suited for traffic prediction. We have studied the effect of other wavelet parameters such as size of the window and number of filter coefficients. We also propose a novel adaptive wavelet predictor which can adapt very well to the changes of incoming bursty traffic.

#!The real-time execution of contemporary complex media applications requires energy-efficient processing capabilities beyond those of current superscalar processors. We observe that the complexity of contemporary media applications requires support for multiple forms of parallelism, including ILP, TLP, and various forms of DLP, such as subword SIMD, short vectors, and streams. Based on our observations, we propose an architecture, called ALP, that efficiently integrates all of these forms of parallelism with evolutionary changes to the programming model and hardware. The novel part of ALP is a DLP technique called SIMD vectors and streams (SVectors/SStreams), which is integrated within a conventional superscalar-based CMP/SMT architecture with subword SIMD. This technique lies between subword SIMD and vectors, providing significant benefits over the former at a lower cost than the latter. Our evaluations show that each form of parallelism supported by ALP is important. Specifically, SVectors/SStreams are effective, compared to a system with the other enhancements in ALP. They give speedups of 1.1 to 3.4X and energy-delay product improvements of 1.1 to 5.1X for applications with DLP.

#!The numerical accuracy of the Interpolated Differential Operator (IDO) scheme is studied with Fourier analysis for the solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs): advection, diffusion, and Poisson equations. The IDO scheme solves governing equations not only for physical variable but also for first-order spatial derivative. Spatial discretizations are based on Hermite interpolation functions with both of them. In the Fourier analysis for the IDO scheme, the Fourier coefficients of the physical variable and the first-order derivative are coupled by the equations derived from the governing equations. The analysis shows the IDO scheme resolves all the wavenumbers with higher accuracy than the fourth-order Finite Difference (FD) and Compact Difference (CD) schemes for advection equation. In particular, for high wavenumbers, the accuracy is superior to that of the sixth-order Combined Compact Difference (CCD) scheme. The diffusion and Poisson equations are also more accurately solved in comparison with the FD and CD schemes. These results show that the IDO scheme guarantees highly resolved solutions for all the terms of fluid flow equations.

#!Motivation: Protein sequence alignment plays a critical role in computational biology as it is an integral part in many analysis tasks designed to solve problems in comparative genomics, structure and function prediction, and homology modeling. Methods: We have developed novel sequence alignment algorithms that compute the alignment between a pair of sequences based on short fixed- or variable-length high-scoring subsequences. Our algorithms build the alignments by repeatedly selecting the highest scoring pairs of subsequences and using them to construct small portions of the final alignment. We utilize PSI-BLAST generated sequence profiles and employ a profile-to-profile scoring scheme derived from PICASSO. Results: We evaluated the performance of the computed alignments on two recently published benchmark datasets and compared them against the alignments computed by existing state-of-the-art dynamic programming-based profile-to-profile local and global sequence alignment algorithms. Our results show that the new algorithms achieve alignments that are comparable with or better than those achieved by existing algorithms. Moreover, our results also showed that these algorithms can be used to provide better information as to which of the aligned positions are more reliable---a critical piece of information for comparative modeling applications.

#!It is well known that one-step Rosenbrock methods may suffer from order reduction for very stiff problems. By considering two-step methods we construct s-stage methods where all stage values have stage order s-1. The proposed class of methods is stable in the sense of zero-stability for arbitrary stepsize sequences. Furthermore there exist L(α)-stable methods with large α for s=4,...,8. Using the concept of effective order we derive methods having order s for constant stepsizes. Numerical experiments show an efficiency superior to RODAS for more stringent tolerances.

#!To exercise better control on the lower tail of the loss distribution and to easily describe the investor's risk attitude, a new class of coherent risk measures is proposed in this paper by taking the minimization of p-norms of lower losses with respect to some reference point. We demonstrate that the new risk measure has satisfactory mathematical properties such as convexity, continuity with respect to parameters included in its definition, the relations between two new risk measures are also examined. The application of the new risk measures for optimal portfolio selection is illustrated by using trade data from the Chinese stock markets. Empirical results not only support our theoretical conclusions, but also show the practicability of the portfolio selection model with our new risk measures.

#!Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a significant role in enhancing rural development in developing countries. However, rural ICT projects are confronted with challenges that result in projects that are not sustainable, or fail altogether. These challenges include access to infrastructure, limited formal education, insufficient training and capacity building, financial and political constraints, and social and cultural challenges. Sustainability is key to the effectiveness of a rural ICT project, therefore it is important to understand the concept and categories associated with ICT project sustainability in rural areas. The categories are social and cultural, institutional, economic, political, and technological sustainability. An exploration of the categories of sustainability is undertaken on an ICT project in rural Dwesa.

#*MRP Rescheduling heuristics with capacity extension under deterministic demand

#!The multi-stage, multi-machine capacitated lot-sizing problem (MSMMCLSP) consists of scheduling the production of one product in a multi-machine production system with a multi-stage structure. Machine capacity is reserved for the production of the end item but can be extended by working overtime (overtime capacity). When a lot size is positive in a specific period, it can be loaded on all machines without exceeding the sum of the regular and overtime capacity limits. In previous research [Rong, C., Takahashi, K., & Morikawa, K. (2005). A new heuristic method for capacitated lot-sizing in multi-stage, multi-machine production systems. Journal of Japan Industrial Management Association, 56(5), in press], we have proposed a rescheduling heuristic to determine a feasible and sufficient solution for the MSMMCLSP with only regular capacity limits, in comparison with Franca et al.'s heuristic method. However, the mechanism of rescheduling in regular time has not optimum (or near optimum) performance for the MSMMCLSP with capacity extension. Preliminary examination revealed that overtime production also has situation-dependent advantages and disadvantages with the combination of various planning parameters. This study, therefore, develops an integrated heuristic that guarantees an optimal solution for general MSMMCLSP by combining the rescheduling mechanism and overtime production. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics by using computational tests with various planning parameters.

#*Large area micro hot embossing of Pyrex glass with GC mold machined by dicing
#@Masaharu Takahashi,Yoichi Murakoshi,Ryutaro Maeda,Kohei Hasegawa

#cMicrosystem Technologies
#index274
#!Micro/Nano imprinting or hot embossing is currently a target of interest for industrial production of micro and Nano devices for the low cost aspect. In Fluidic MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) applications, polymer materials have been widely employed for their low cost to fabricate the economical products (Becker and Heim in Sens Acuators A 83:120&#x2013;135, 2000; Becker and Gaertner in Mol Biotechnol 82:89&#x2013;99, 2001). However glasses are much more suitable for the higher temperature applications or under the stronger chemical environments. Moreover UV absorption of glass materials is much less than that of polymers, which is the advantage for bio-analysis. In Optical MEMS as well, glasses are good candidate materials for the better optical properties, such as high refractive index, low UV absorption and others. Although wet etching of glasses is widely employed for fabrication of fluidic MEMS devices, the wet etching is not satisfactory for the low machining resolution, the isotropic etched profile and poor roughness of the fabricated structures. Dry etching of glasses is then an alternative for Micro/Nano structuring, but the etching rate is extremely low (order of 0.1&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m/min) and the cost is too high because of the expensive RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) facility. Above mentioned is the reason why we are interested in hot embossing or imprinting of glasses of Micro/Nano scale. In our previous study, Micro/Nano imprinting was developed for Pyrex glasses using GC (Glassy Carbon) mold prepared by FIB machining (Takahashi et al. in Symposium on DTIP 2004 pp 441&#x2013;446, 2004). The disadvantage of FIB machining is limited area of etching. The typical area of FIB is less than several hundreds micrometer square. This is the reason why we tried the large area of embossing using GC mold fabricated by dicing machine. Micro hot embossed test structures were successfully demonstrated with good fidelity. Fabricated micro structures can be applied for fabrication of microchamber array for PCR (Akagi et al. in Sci Techol Adv Mater 5:343&#x2013;349, 2004; Nagai et al. in Anal Chem 73:1043&#x2013;1047, 2001).

#!Polymeric microfluidic chips are an enabling component for cost-effective, point of care analytical devices for pharmaceutical, agriculture, health, biological and medical applications. The microfluidic structures can be completed with active elements like pumps and valves as well as sensor components for more complex so called total analysis systems. Often, systems are designed as reader and disposable cartridge where the fluidic structures are simple devices that will be inserted into the reader, which executes the analytical protocol and displays the information in digital form, and disposed after completion of the analysis. In this paper, a hybrid fabrication approach was employed to build a polymeric microfluidic device, so-called sweatstick, suitable for collecting small, precise amounts (600&#x00a0;&#x03bc;l) of human sweat, which were further analyzed for the amount of calcium ions indicating bone mass loss. The device was assembled from different parts fabricated by ultra deep X-ray lithography, precision micro-milling, and molding. Surface treatment of liquid exposed surfaces by oxygen plasma ensures hydrophilic behavior and proper capillary action. Preliminary testing of the device was performed by collecting defined amounts of sweat simulant and determining the calcium ion content using a fluorescent technique. The results for low calcium ion concentration typical for human sweat were excellent and repeatable with variation less than 5% demonstrating the ability to perform indirect bone loss measurements.

#!Modern real-time systems consist of complex parallel and heterogeneous architectures. Early design decisions, such as the partitioning of functionality onto architecture building blocks and the choice of algorithms, have a large impact on the quality of the resulting platform. In order to support the designer during this concept phase we have developed our performance evaluation framework SystemQ. In this paper, we demonstrate why multiclass queuing networks as used by SystemQ are a natural abstraction for evaluating network processing platforms. In particular we reveal the impact of scheduling policies on the Quality-of- Service, such as the residence time of network traffic in the system. For the same stimuli the packet latency can vary by more than one order of magnitude if only one queuing discipline in the system is modified.

#!Mobile handsets have found an important place in modern society, with hundreds of millions currently in use. The majority of these devices use inherently weak authentication mechanisms, based upon passwords and PINs. This paper presents a feasibility study into a biometric-based technique, known as keystroke analysis &#x2013; which authenticates the user based upon their typing characteristic. In particular, this paper identifies two typical handset interactions, entering telephone numbers and typing text messages, and seeks to authenticate the user during their normal handset interaction. It was found that neural network classifiers were able to perform classification with average equal error rates of 12.8%. Based upon these results, the paper concludes by proposing a flexible and robust framework to permit the continuous and transparent authentication of the user, thereby maximising security and minimising user inconvenience, to service the needs of the insecure and evermore functional mobile handset.

#!In this paper, we focus on affect recognition from text in order to facilitate sensitive and expressive communication in computer-mediated environments. Our model for analyzing affect conveyed by text is tailored to handle the style and specifics of informal online conversations. The motivation behind our approach is to improve social interactivity and emotional expressiveness of real-time messaging.In order to estimate affect in text, our model processes symbolic cues, such as emoticons, detects and transforms abbreviations, and employs natural language processing techniques for word/phrase/sentence-level analysis, e.g. by considering relations among words in a sentence. As a result of the analysis, text can be categorized into emotional states and communicative functions. A designed graphical representation of a user (avatar) displays emotions and social behaviour driven by text and performs natural idle movements. The proposed system shows promising results on affect recognition in real examples of online conversation.

#!A module-based modeling method was developed to analyze the production-distribution systems by using a discrete event simulation with ARENA. Excel VBA was also adopted to automatically generate the simulation programs. Using the proposed method, one can quickly create a multistage, multi-item supply chain system such as serials, convergent, divergent or general networks, for analyzing the performance of a supply chain. Both inventory control and shipment consolidation policy were considered in this study. A number of outputs can be used as a performance measure in the decision making; for example, transportation costs, inventory level and costs, and the fill rate. An actual application model was generated using the proposed method. The result shows that the module-based method is a powerful tool for modeling the supply chain systems.

#*A New Scheme to Realize the Optimum Watermark Detection for the Additive Embedding Scheme with the Spatial Domain
#@Takaaki Fujita,Maki Yoshida,Toru Fujiwara
#t2007
#cIEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics, Communications and Computer Sciences
#index299
#!A typical watermarking scheme consists of an embedding scheme and a detection scheme. In detecting a watermark, there are two kinds of detection errors, a false positive error (FPE) and a false negative error (FNE). A detection scheme is said to be optimum if the FNE probability is minimized for a given FPE probability. In this paper, we present an optimum watermark detection scheme for an additive embedding scheme with a spatial domain. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to use the differences between two brightnesses for detecting a watermark. We prove that under the same FPE probability the FNE probability of the proposed optimum detection scheme is no more than that of the previous optimum detection scheme for the additive embedding scheme with the spatial domain. Then, it is confirmed that for an actual image, the FNE probability of the proposed optimum detection scheme is much lower than that of the previous optimum detection scheme. Moreover, it is confirmed experimentally that the proposed optimum detection scheme can control the FPE probability strictly so that the FPE probability is close to a given probability.

#!We consider a variant of Heilbronn's triangle problem by asking for a distribution of n points in the d-dimensional unit cube [0, 1]d such that the minimum (two-dimensional) area of a triangle among these n points is as large as possible. Denoting by Δdoff-line (n) and Δdon-line (n) the supremum of the minimum area of a triangle among n points over all distributions of n points in [0, 1]d for the off-line and the on-line situation, respectively, for fixed dimension d ≥ 2 we show that c1ċ(log n)1/(d-1)/n2/(d-1) ≤ Δdoff-line(n) ≤ c'1/n2/d and c2/n2/(d-1) ≤ Δdon-line (n) ≤ c'2/n2/d for constants c1, c2, c'1,c'2 > 0 which depend on d only. Moreover, we provide a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that achieves the lower bound Ω((log n)1/(d-1))/n2/(d-1)) on the minimum area of a triangle among n points in [0, 1]d in the off-line case.

#!Suffix trees and suffix arrays are widely used and largely interchangeable index structures on strings and sequences. Practitioners prefer suffix arrays due to their simplicity and space efficiency while theoreticians use suffix trees due to linear-time construction algorithms and more explicit structure. We narrow this gap between theory and practice with a simple linear-time construction algorithm for suffix arrays. The simplicity is demonstrated with a C&plus;&plus; implementation of 50 effective lines of code. The algorithm is called DC3, which stems from the central underlying concept of difference cover. This view leads to a generalized algorithm, DC, that allows a space-efficient implementation and, moreover, supports the choice of a space--time tradeoff. For any v &isin; &lsqb;1,&nradic;&rsqb;, it runs in O(vn) time using O(n/&vradic;) space in addition to the input string and the suffix array. We also present variants of the algorithm for several parallel and hierarchical memory models of computation. The algorithms for BSP and EREW-PRAM models are asymptotically faster than all previous suffix tree or array construction algorithms.

#!Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on the construction of exponential integrators for semilinear problems. In this article we describe a MATLAB1 package which aims to facilitate the quick deployment and testing of exponential integrators, of Runge--Kutta, multistep, and general linear type. A large number of integrators are included in this package along with several well-known examples. The so-called &phiv; functions and their evaluation is crucial for accuracy, stability, and efficiency of exponential integrators, and the approach taken here is through a modification of the scaling and squaring technique, the most common approach used for computing the matrix exponential.

#!Personal Networks and PN federations are new networking paradigms that merge concepts from ad hoc, P2P and wireless networks, built around user's needs. Even though they are a promise of a practical achievement of ubiquitous computing, managing security associations in these frameworks proves to be a challenge. We present in this paper a security architecture, including a uniform personal namespace using crypto-based identifiers and a key management scheme based on identity-based cryptography. We also provide an evaluation of our scheme, in terms of computation complexity, communication cost and security.

#!With the diverging improvements in CPU speeds and memory access latencies, detecting and removing memory access bottlenecks becomes increasingly important. In this work we present METRIC, a software framework for isolating and understanding such bottlenecks using partial access traces. METRIC extracts access traces from executing programs without special compiler or linker support. We make four primary contributions. First, we present a framework for extracting partial access traces based on dynamic binary rewriting of the executing application. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm for compressing these traces. The algorithm generates constant space representations for regular accesses occurring in nested loop structures. Third, we use these traces for offline incremental memory hierarchy simulation. We extract symbolic information from the application executable and use this to generate detailed source-code correlated statistics including per-reference metrics, cache evictor information, and stream metrics. Finally, we demonstrate how this information can be used to isolate and understand memory access inefficiencies. This illustrates a potential advantage of METRIC over compile-time analysis for sample codes, particularly when interprocedural analysis is required.

#!In the last years there has been a growing interest worldwide in the application of agent technology for providing dynamic, flexible, and compound services. In this paper we report the design and implementation of a multi-agent system that provides health care-related services to the citizens and visitors of a city. The agents of the system allow the user to access his/her medical record, to find out information about the medical centres of the city, and to make a booking to be visited by a particular kind of doctor. Doctors may access and update the medical record of the patient during a visit, and they may also request the performance of clinical tests on the patient. The results of the tests are automatically stored in the patient's medical record, so that they can be accessed by the doctor in the next visit. Two key issues in the design and implementation of the system are discussed: the definition of a basic medical ontology and the implementation of security measures that preserve the confidentiality of sensitive medical information.

#!In this paper we present an explicit disk-based verification algorithm for Probabilistic Systems defining discrete time/finite state Markov Chains. Given a Markov Chain and an integer k (horizon), our algorithm checks whether the probability of reaching an error state in at most k steps is below a given threshold. We present an implementation of our algorithm within a suitable extension of the Mur&#x03d5; verifier. We call the resulting probabilistic model checker FHP-Mur&#x03d5; (Finite Horizon ProbabilisticMur&#x03d5;). We present experimental results comparing FHP-Mur&#x03d5; with (a finite horizon subset of) PRISM, a state-of-the-art symbolic model checker for Markov Chains. Our experimental results show that FHP-Mur&#x03d5; can handle systems that are out of reach for PRISM, namely those involving arithmetic operations on the state variables (e.g. hybrid systems).

#!Prediction of the cellular location of a protein plays an important role in inferring the function of the protein. Feature extraction is a critical part in prediction systems, requiring raw sequence data to be transformed into appropriate numerical feature vectors while minimizing information loss. In this paper, we present a method for extracting useful features from protein sequence data. The method employs local and global pairwise sequence alignment scores as well as composition-based features. Five different features are used for training support vector machines (SVMs) separately and a weighted majority voting makes a final decision. The overall prediction accuracy evaluated by the 5-fold cross-validation reached 88.53% for the eukaryotic animal data set. Comparing the prediction accuracy of various feature extraction methods, provides a biological insight into the location of targeting information. Our experimental results confirm that our feature extraction methods are very useful for predicting subcellular localization of proteins.

#!Organizations change with the dynamics of the world. To enable organizations to change, certain structures and capabilities are needed. As all processes, a change process has an organization of its own. In this paper it is shown how within a formal organization modeling approach also organizational change processes can be modeled. A generic organization model (covering both organization structure and behavior) for organizational change is presented and formally evaluated for a case study. This model takes into account different phases in a change process considered in Organization Theory literature, such as unfreezing, movement and refreezing. Moreover, at the level of individuals, the internal beliefs and their changes are incorporated in the model. In addition, an internal mental model for (reflective) reasoning about expected role behavior is included in the organization model.

#!In this paper, we propose a novel path-based control method for generating realistic smoke animations. Our method allows an animator to specify a 3D curve for the smoke to follow. Path control is then achieved using a linear (closed) feedback loop to match the velocity field obtained from a 3D flow simulation with a target velocity field. The target velocity field can be generated in a variety of ways and may include the small scale swirling motion characteristic of turbulent flows. We provide several examples of complex smoke paths to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

#!This paper investigates the compositional properties of reusable software components defined with explicit dependencies and behavioural contracts expressing rely-guarantee specifications in the form of communication traces. In this setting, connection of components through their matching ports is indeed compositional and yields a new component or composite that respects its constituents' contracts. Thus the behaviour of the composite is computed from the behaviours of its constituents and is known to conform to the contracts without any new proof.

#!In this paper, we propose an optimization-based approach for Quality of Service (QoS) routing in high-bandwidth networks. We view a network that employs QoS routing as an entity that distributively optimizes some global utility function. By solving the optimization problem, the network is driven to an efficient operating point. In earlier work, it has been shown that when the capacity of the network is large, this optimization takes on a simple form, and once the solution to this optimization problem is found, simple proportional QoS routing schemes will suffice. However, this optimization problem requires global information. We develop a distributed and adaptive algorithm that can efficiently solve the optimization online. Compared with existing QoS routing schemes, the proposed optimization-based approach has the following advantages: 1) the computation and communication overhead can be greatly reduced without sacrificing performance; 2) the operating characteristics of the network can be analytically studied; and 3) the desired operating point can be tuned by choosing appropriate utility functions.

#!Enterprise integration through integrated business information systems (IBIS) is necessary to achieve agility in the current age of hyper-competition. Multi-agent systems (MAS) provide a new paradigm for IBIS development. In this paper, we review the IBIS modeling and MAS literatures and find that the MAS paradigm provides an excellent approach for modeling and implementing IBIS systems. We synthesize these two bodies of literature and propose a conceptual framework for multi-agent-based integrative business information systems (MIBIS) and a unified set of eight orthogonal ontological constructs that are minimally required for any conceptual modeling grammar for the MIBIS bounded universe of discourse.

#!Traffic microsimulation is increasingly a preferred method of traffic analysis for today's transportation professionals. The importance of properly calibrating these traffic simulations is evidenced by the adoption of microsimulation calibration standards by several state and federal transportation authorities. A component of the calibration process is the calibration of the simulation for capacity. Capacity is a high-level measurement that is a function of many lower-level user-defined input parameters. VISSIM utilizes psy-chophysical car-following models that rely on ten user-defined parameters to represent freeway driving behavior. Several VISSIM driver behavior parameters have been shown to have a significant impact on roadway capacity. This paper seeks further understanding of the performance of the VISSIM traffic microsimulator by investigating the impact of driver behavior parameter combinations on a measure of freeway capacity. This paper is intended to provide insight useful for manual calibration of VISSIM microsimulation or the development of calibration algorithms.

#!Language model information retrieval depends on accurate estimation of document models. In this paper, we propose a document expansion technique to deal with the problem of insufficient sampling of documents. We construct a probabilistic neighborhood for each document, and expand the document with its neighborhood information. The expanded document provides a more accurate estimation of the document model, thus improves retrieval accuracy. Moreover, since document expansion and pseudo feedback exploit different corpus structures, they can be combined to further improve performance. The experiment results on several different data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed document expansion method.

#!A new application architecture is designed for continuous, real-time, distributed wireless sensor networks. We develop a wireless sensor network for machinery condition-based maintenance (CBM) in small machinery spaces using commercially available products. We develop a hardware platform, networking architecture, and medium access communication protocol. We implement a single-hop sensor network to facilitate real-time monitoring and extensive data processing for machine monitoring. A new radio battery consumption model is presented and the battery consumption equation is used to select the most suitable topology and design an energy efficient communication protocol for wireless sensor networks. A new streamlined matrix formulation is developed that allows the base station to compute the best periodic sleep times for all the nodes in the network. We combine scheduling and contention to design a hybrid MAC protocol, which achieves 100&percnt; collision avoidance by using our modified RTS-CTS contention mechanism known as UC-TDMA protocol. A LabVIEW graphical user interface is described that allows for signal processing, including FFT, various moments, and kurtosis. A wireless CBM sensor network implementation on a heating and air conditioning plant is presented as a case study.

#!We investigate the structure of addresses contained in IPv4 traffic--specifically, the structural characteristics of destination IP addresses seen on Internet links, considered as a subset of the address space. These characteristics have implications for algorithms that deal with IP address aggregates, such as routing lookups and aggregate-based congestion control. Several example address structures are well modeled by multifractal Cantor-like sets with two parameters. This model may be useful for simulations where realistic IP addresses are preferred. We also develop concise characterizations of address structures, including active aggregate counts and discriminating prefixes. Our structural characterizations are stable over short time scales at a given site, and different sites have visibly different characterizations, so that the characterizations make useful "fingerprints" of the traffic seen at a site. Also, changing traffic conditions, such as worm propagation, significantly alter these fingerprints.

#!Intelligent desktop environments allow the desktop user to define a set of projects or activities that characterize the user's desktop work. These environments then attempt to identify the current activity of the user in order to provide various kinds of assistance. These systems take a hybrid approach in which they allow the user to declare their current activity but they also employ learned classifiers to predict the current activity to cover those cases where the user forgets to declare the current activity. The classifiers must be trained on the very noisy data obtained from the user's activity declarations. Instead of asking the user to review and relabel the data manually, we employ an active EM algorithm that combines the EM algorithm and active learning. EM can be viewed as retraining on its own predictions. To make it more robust, we only retrain on those predictions that are made with high confidence. For active learning, we make a small number of queries to the user based on the most uncertain instances. Experimental results on real users show this active EM algorithm can significantly improve the prediction precision, and that it performs better than either EM or active learning alone.

#!Software Performance Engineering (SPE) methods have been in use for over two decades as an approach to manage the risks of developing systems that fail to satisfy their performance requirements. In general, SPE advocates the use of performance oriented design principles to guide design decisions and predictive performance models to assess the performance impact of design alternatives. SPE methods have been used successfully to identify and overcome system design blunders early in the Information Technology (IT) project lifecycle before the blunders are built into a system and become expensive and time consuming to correct. While the methods have been used successfully in some IT project domains, they are not widely applied in the important domain of Enterprise Application (EA) systems. This experience paper considers the reasons for this and explores the role of SPE as new EA platform and data centre technologies become available.We find that many risks traditionally addressed by SPE have been mitigated by the nature of existing EA platforms, the nature of today's IT projects for EA, and an attention to business process modeling. Furthermore, the design and implementation of future EA systems will see some performance risks reduced even further by new EA and IT system management platforms for Next Generation Data Centres. However, we expect that the nature of EA systems to be built is becoming more complex. As a result some familiar performance risks will re-emerge along with new runtime risks. We believe that SPE methods can help to mitigate such risks and describe research challenges that must be addressed to make this a reality.

To help you understand VoIP networks, Voice over IP Fundamentals provides a thorough introduction to the basics of VoIP.Voice over IP Fundamentals explains how a basic IP telephony infrastructure is built and works today, major concepts concerning voice and data networking, and transmission of voice over data networks. You'll learn how voice is signaled through legacy telephone networks, how IP signaling protocols are used to interoperate with current telephony systems, and how to ensure good voice quality using quality of service (QoS).Even though Voice over IP Fundamentals is written for anyone seeking to understand how to use IP to transport voice, its target audience comprises both voice and data networking professionals. In the past, professionals working in voice and data networking did not have to understand each other's roles. However, in this world of time-division multiplexing (TDM) and IP convergence, it is important to understand how these technologies work together. Voice over IP Fundamentals explains all the details so that voice experts can understand data networking and data experts can understand voice networking.The second edition of this best-selling book includes new chapters on the importance of billing and mediation in a VoIP network, security, and the common types of threats inherent when packet voice environments, public switched telephone networks (PSTN), and VoIP interoperate. It also explains enterprise and service-provider applications and services.ï¾

#!In this paper we discuss a strategy for reducing the computational cost of a re-parameterisation procedure to be used in algebraic numerical grid generation. The re-parameterisation phase is based on a tensor product transformation following given directions. The free parameters in the tensor product are set by solving the discretization of an elliptic differential system of small size, via an iterative scheme, thus generating a grid conforming to the boundary of a prescribed domain with orthogonal inner grid cells and with almost constant aspect ratio. The bases involved in the tensor product are refinable, i.e., they can be written as linear combination of dilate of translates of their-self. This property allows us to use few iterations of the corresponding subdivision algorithm to produce a good parameter distribution.

#!A simple low-cost technique has been developed to fabricate a mold insert for replicating polymeric tapered high aspect ratio microstructures. A backside exposure technique is used to first obtain a tapered sidewall structure as an electroplating mold in SU-8 photoresist on a glass wafer. Nickel electroplating is utilized to form the mold insert. The lowest average surface roughness of the nickel mold insert on the side that interfaces with the glass wafer during electroplating is measured to be 7.02&#x00a0;nm. A novel technique involving use of titanium putty is introduced here to reduce cost and effort required to fabricate the mold insert. Replication of tapered microstructures in polymeric materials utilizing the fabricated mold insert is demonstrated here in polydimethylsiloxane by a direct molding process and in polymethyl methacrylate by hot embossing. The fabrication details for the mold insert are described. Advantages and disadvantages of the use of titanium putty for achieving superior metal surface finish are given.

#!This paper presents a Web-based interior design application named Multiuser Interior Design (MID). We use technologies from virtual reality (VR), the Web, and database to implement MID. It allows users to operate in the VR fashion, interacting with objects in the 3D, virtual space. Users need only a Web browser to view and elaborate designs, examine furniture, place purchase orders, etc. MID contains many useful functions and features Web-based multiuser collaboration. We introduce the user-interface and main functions of MID that users will operate. The technical aspect of MID, including software architecture and underlying technologies, is also presented. MID can be easily modified for other purposes; only information-related portions need modification, and the other portions serve as reusable framework.

#cInformation Retrieval
#index469
#!Intelligent use of the many diverse forms of data available on the Internet requires new tools for managing and manipulating heterogeneous forms of information. This paper uses WHIRL, an extension of relational databases that can manipulate textual data using statistical similarity measures developed by the information retrieval community. We show that although WHIRL is designed for more general similarity-based reasoning tasks, it is competitive with mature systems designed explicitly for inductive classification. In particular, WHIRL is well suited for combining different sources of knowledge in the classification process. We show on a diverse set of tasks that the use of appropriate sets of unlabeled background knowledge often decreases error rates, particularly if the number of examples or the size of the strings in the training set is small. This is especially useful when labeling text is a labor-intensive job and when there is a large amount of information available about a particular problem on the World Wide Web.

#%163057
#!In this paper, a procedure for dealing with the multi-user synchronisation problem in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based systems for ad hoc environments is proposed and analysed. We show with this novel approach that it is possible to re-use much of the already extent literature for single-user synchronisation in OFDM and apply it to multi-user ad hoc scenarios. Also a distributed version of the procedure is proposed in order to fairly share out the power consumption among all the devices. The proposed procedure makes use of higher layer capabilities in a cross-layer design and it does not incur too much complexity or power. This issue is specially critical in wireless heterogeneous ad hoc networks where devices can be very limited in terms of transmission and/or computational power.

#index473
#!Conditional random fields (CRFs) have been successfully applied to various applications of predicting and labeling structured data, such as natural language tagging & parsing, image segmentation & object recognition, and protein secondary structure prediction. The key advantages of CRFs are the ability to encode a variety of overlapping, non-independent features from empirical data as well as the capability of reaching the global normalization and optimization. However, estimating parameters for CRFs is very time-consuming due to an intensive forward-backward computation needed to estimate the likelihood function and its gradient during training. This paper presents a high-performance training of CRFs on massively parallel processing systems that allows us to handle huge datasets with hundreds of thousand data sequences and millions of features. We performed the experiments on an important natural language processing task (text chunking) on large-scale corpora and achieved significant results in terms of both the reduction of computational time and the improvement of prediction accuracy.

#!A growing number of business process management software vendors are offering simulation capabilities to extend their modeling functions and enhance their analytical proficiencies. Simulation is promoted to enable examination and testing of decisions prior to actually making them in the "real" environment. In this paper, we illustrate how to optimize simulation models, by presenting two examples of simulation optimization using OptQuest&reg;. In the first case, we construct a discrete event simulation model of a hospital emergency room to determine a configuration of resources that results in the shortest average cycle time for patients. In the second case, we develop a simulation model to minimize staffing levels for personal claims processing in an insurance company. We then summarize some of the most relevant approaches that have been developed for the purpose of optimizing simulated systems and conclude with a metaheuristic black box approach that leads the field of practical applications.

#!We present a broad algorithmic framework for transforming an image comprised of pixels into a vectorized image segmented into polygons that can be subsequently used in image analysis, understanding, and high-level representation. We introduce a new entity-the trixel-that is an adaptive, local, triangular unit of region-contour picture description. Adjacent trixels are merged based on certain elementary heuristic criteria of perceptual organization, modeled as geometric filters on trixel edges. The connected components of a trixel grouping graph, with vertices representing trixels and edges between vertices corresponding to merged adjacent trixels, yield polygons that segment the image.

#!We have explored the usefulness of incorporating speech and discourse features in an automatic speech summarization system applied to meeting recordings from the ICSI Meetings corpus. By analyzing speaker activity, turn-taking and discourse cues, we hypothesize that such a system can outperform solely text-based methods inherited from the field of text summarization. The summarization methods are described, two evaluation methods are applied and compared, and the results clearly show that utilizing such features is advantageous and efficient. Even simple methods relying on discourse cues and speaker activity can outperform text summarization approaches.

#*Data representations and generalization error in kernel based learning machines

#cPattern Recognition
#index497
#%441539
#%531457
#!This paper focuses on the problem of how data representation influences the generalization error of kernel based learning machines like support vector machines (SVM) for classification. Frame theory provides a well founded mathematical framework for representing data in many different ways. We analyze the effects of sparse and dense data representations on the generalization error of such learning machines measured by using leave-one-out error given a finite amount of training data. We show that, in the case of sparse data representations, the generalization error of an SVM trained by using polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions is equal to the one of a linear SVM. This is equivalent to saying that the capacity of separating points of functions belonging to hypothesis spaces induced by polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions reduces to the capacity of a separating hyperplane in the input space. Moreover, we show that, in general, sparse data representations increase or leave unchanged the generalization error of kernel based methods. Dense data representations, on the contrary, reduce the generalization error in the case of very large frames. We use two different schemes for representing data in overcomplete systems of Haar and Gabor functions, and measure SVM generalization error on benchmarked data sets.

#!This paper deals with the bias correction of the cross-validation (CV) criterion to estimate the predictive Kullback-Leibler information. A bias-corrected CV criterion is proposed by replacing the ordinary maximum likelihood estimator with the maximizer of the adjusted log-likelihood function. The adjustment is just slight and simple, but the improvement of the bias is remarkable. The bias of the ordinary CV criterion is O(n-1), but that of the bias-corrected CV criterion is O(n-2). We verify that our criterion has smaller bias than the AIC, TIC, EIC and the ordinary CV criterion by numerical experiments.

#*Two's-complement multiplication
#@A. E. Sheue
#t1979
#cACM SIGMICRO Newsletter
#index503
#!Two's complement multiplication, defined in terms of adds, subtracts, and shifts, is derived from a novel expression relating a two's-complement number and its integer interpretation. Although the derived algorithm is considered well known, the derivation itself is believed to be original and easily grasped. Implementation of the algorithm in terms of computer arithmetic is shown to be safe from overflow except for the case when the multiplier is 10...0 (max. negative). In this case, the resulting product will have the proper magnitude but the wrong algebraic sign. The implementation can, however, be modified to handle this special case properly.

#*Lightweight natural language text compression

#cInformation Retrieval

#!Variants of Huffman codes where words are taken as the source symbols are currently the most attractive choices to compress natural language text databases. In particular, Tagged Huffman Code by Moura et al. offers fast direct searching on the compressed text and random access capabilities, in exchange for producing around 11% larger compressed files. This work describes End-Tagged Dense Code and (s, c)-Dense Code, two new semistatic statistical methods for compressing natural language texts. These techniques permit simpler and faster encoding and obtain better compression ratios than Tagged Huffman Code, while maintaining its fast direct search and random access capabilities. We show that Dense Codes improve Tagged Huffman Code compression ratio by about 10%, reaching only 0.6% overhead over the optimal Huffman compression ratio. Being simpler, Dense Codes are generated 45% to 60% faster than Huffman codes. This makes Dense Codes a very attractive alternative to Huffman code variants for various reasons: they are simpler to program, faster to build, of almost optimal size, and as fast and easy to search as the best Huffman variants, which are not so close to the optimal size.

#!We describe a discrete event simulation model of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV disease, parameterized to describe the dual epidemics in Harare, Zimbabwe. TB and HIV are the leading causes of death from infectious disease among adults worldwide and the number of TB cases has risen significantly since the start of the HIV epidemic, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the HIV epidemic is most severe. There is a need to devise new strategies for TB control in countries with a high prevalence of HIV. This model has been designed to investigate strategies for reducing TB transmission by more efficient TB case detection. The model structure and its validation are discussed.

In the latter group only few propose automatic grid alignment and batch mode. More often than not a program implements only one quantification algorithm. AGScan is an open source program that works on all major platforms. It is based on the ImageJ library [Rasband (1997--2006)] and offers a plug-in extension system to add new functions to manipulate images, align grid and quantify spots. It is appropriate for daily laboratory use and also as a framework for new algorithms. Availability: The program is freely distributed under X11 Licence. The install instructions can be found in the user manual. The software can be downloaded from http://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/projects/agscan/.

#!The hit-or-miss transform (HMT) is a fundamental operation on binary images, widely used since 40 years. As it is not increasing, its extension to grey-level images is not straightforward, and very few authors have considered it. Moreover, despite its potential usefulness, very few applications of the grey-level HMT have been proposed until now. Part I of this paper, developed hereafter, is devoted to the description of a theory leading to a unification of the main definitions of the grey-level HMT, mainly proposed by Ronse and Soille, respectively (part II will deal with the applicative potential of the grey-level HMT, which will be illustrated by its use for vessel segmentation from 3D angiographic data). In this first part, we review the previous approaches to the grey-level HMT, especially the supremal one of Ronse, and the integral one of Soille; the latter was defined only for flat structuring elements (SEs), but it can be generalized to non-flat ones. We present a unified theory of the grey-level HMT, which is decomposed into two steps. First a fitting associates to each point the set of grey-levels for which the SEs can be fitted to the image; as in Soille's approach, this fitting step can be constrained. Next, a valuation associates a final grey-level value to each point; we propose three valuations: supremal (as in Ronse), integral (as in Soille) and binary.

#!Traditional Computer Science curricula focus on the training for logic reasoning and programming skills. System integration is often not covered in computer science curricula. As the embedded platforms migrate from 8-bit microprocessors to 32-bit microprocessors, the engineers require different skills to design modern embedded systems. The Computer Science faculties at several universities in Taiwan have collaborated to design a new course to meet such needs. In this course, we focus on the capability of integrating hardware and software in networked embedded systems. In particular, the students learn the skills for embedded real-time programming, multi-thread programming, low-power network protocols, security, and wireless networks protocol. In this article, we report the design rationale and current status of this course.

The assessment model is based on both a deterministic calculation following the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology in a Danish manual from the Ministry of Transport and on a stochastic calculation, where risk analysis (RA) is carried out using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). After a description of the deterministic and stochastic calculations emphasis is paid to the RA part of CBA-DK with considerations about which probability distributions to make use of. Furthermore, a comprehensive assessment of the set of distributions are made. Finally conclusions and a perspective are presented.

#!A novel algorithm for image segmentation is proposed. The proposed method incorporates geodesic curves and C-V method to raise active contours' performance on image segmentation. Moreover, we extend our method to color images. By practical experiments, it is verified that our model obtains better results than original methods, especially with respect to images within holes, complex background, weak edges, and noise.

#!In this paper, we aim at giving a contribution toward the definition of a UML profile supporting the dependability analysis of real-time and embedded systems (RTES) that conforms to the upcoming profile named "Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems" (MARTE), for which a Request For Proposal has been issued by the Object Management Group (OMG).A set of basic dependability and fault-tolerance concepts need to be included in the profile to support the dependability analysis of RTES. We have exploited the best practices, proposed in the literature, on extending UML with dependability modeling capabilities in order to draw up a check list of requirements to be used as guideline for the definition of a dependability analysis profile. The proposed profile is then applied to the UML design of a case study: a gas turbine control system.

#!Since their introduction as a means of front propagation and their first application to edge-based segmentation in the early 90's, level set methods have become increasingly popular as a general framework for image segmentation. In this paper, we present a survey of a specific class of region-based level set segmentation methods and clarify how they can all be derived from a common statistical framework.Region-based segmentation schemes aim at partitioning the image domain by progressively fitting statistical models to the intensity, color, texture or motion in each of a set of regions. In contrast to edge-based schemes such as the classical Snakes, region-based methods tend to be less sensitive to noise. For typical images, the respective cost functionals tend to have less local minima which makes them particularly well-suited for local optimization methods such as the level set method.We detail a general statistical formulation for level set segmentation. Subsequently, we clarify how the integration of various low level criteria leads to a set of cost functionals. We point out relations between the different segmentation schemes. In experimental results, we demonstrate how the level set function is driven to partition the image plane into domains of coherent color, texture, dynamic texture or motion. Moreover, the Bayesian formulation allows to introduce prior shape knowledge into the level set method. We briefly review a number of advances in this domain.

#!We present a novel interface for directing the actions of computer animated characters and camera movements. Our system takes spoken input in combination with mouse pointing to generate desired character animation based on motion capture data. The aim is to achieve a more natural animation interface by supporting the types of dialogue and pointing that might be used when one person is explaining a desired motion to another person. We compare our voice-driven system with a button-driven animation interface that has equivalent capabilities. An informal user study indicates that for the test scenarios, the voice-user interface (VUI) is faster than an equivalent graphical user interface (GUI). Potential applications include storyboarding for film or theatre, directing characters in video games, and scene reconstruction.

#!Informational logic is a new approach to the formalization of the notion of rational conjecture that is of interest both from the epistemic and the automated reasoning point of view. Given a logical system $T$, an informational logic is based on a new measure of logical information (which is defined on $T$&dash;formulas) and on a mathematical definition of estimate criteria for proofs in $T$. This allows us to obtain a notion of informational theorem $(L,p(L))$ of a system $T$, where $p(L)$ is the probability of $L$ to be provable in $T$. The notion of probability is entirely founded on proof&dash;theoretic concepts. In this paper, informational logic is presented, and applications of this idea to the representation of inductive reasoning and to automated theorem proving are shown.

#!Simulation professionals understand the importance of accurate data for model validation. Traditional sources of simulation data come from information technology systems, manual records from staff, observations, and estimates by subject matter experts.This paper discusses how Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies were used on a recent consulting engagement at a hospital. Data collected through RFID can validate or replace activity duration estimates from traditional sources. However, the accuracy and cost effectiveness of RFID is not guaranteed. A sound methodology was developed, which included rigorous planning and testing of hardware, processes and data analysis.Hardware vendors needed to understand what the simulation required so they could properly setup equipment and software. Also, ED staff needed to understand the purpose of this data collection to avoid anxiety about personnel evaluations. Finally, efficient and reliable issue and collection of patient tags was crucial to the success of this effort.

#!There has been little research into how end users might be able to communicate advice to machine learning systems. If this resource--the users themselves--could somehow work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the accuracy of learning systems could be improved and the users' understanding and trust of the system could improve as well. We conducted a think-aloud study to see how willing users were to provide feedback and to understand what kinds of feedback users could give. Users were shown explanations of machine learning predictions and asked to provide feedback to improve the predictions. We found that users had no difficulty providing generous amounts of feedback. The kinds of feedback ranged from suggestions for reweighting of features to proposals for new features, feature combinations, relational features, and wholesale changes to the learning algorithm. The results show that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve machine learning systems, but that learning algorithms need to be extended in several ways to be able to assimilate this feedback.

#!Organizational reformation is inevitable, during the pursuing of larger scales of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In this work, a case study of the pharmaceutical industry in China is presented to show how process-based simulation can be applied to the quantitative studies on the organizational structure reformation. Through modeling core business processes and limited resources in the sales and marketing division of the enterprise, a simulation experiment is performed to analyze how the employees' working hours distribute in daily work. It is found that salesmen only spend 40% working time on the effort of marketing expansion and sales increase. It takes more than half the working time for them to track the progress of logistics affairs. So, it may be concluded that the company in the case should improve the specialization of the organizational design, and especially should consider outsourcing the professional logistics service.

#%236286
#!This paper describes a novel framework used to characterize a J2EE (Java Enterprise Edition) application and develop models of the application by using Java method tracing in a Java-technology based application server. Application servers are critical to large-scale, online servers and serve as middleware to provide secure access to transactional, legacy and web services. The tracing tool in this framework gives a detailed and comprehensive view of the sequences of methods invoked as the application server processes requests. The output of this tool is processed and automatically summarized into a set of transaction profiles which form the input for a simulation model of the application server and its related components. These profiles have proven to be a useful abstraction of the behavior of the transactions processed by the system. After describing the tool and the model, the paper provides results of validation runs and discusses the usefulness of quantitative measurement, analysis and modeling in some areas of system design and system deployment. The models help architects, designers, developers and deployers explore the different facets of performance during all stages of an application's life-cycle, especially during concept development and prototyping.

#!There is an increasing need for the comprehensive simulation of complex, dynamic, physical systems. Often such simulations are built by coupling existing, component models so that their concurrent simulations affect each other. The process of model coupling is, however, a non-trivial task that is not adequately supported by existing frameworks. To provide better support, we have developed an approach to model coupling that uses high level model interfaces called Potential Coupling Interfaces. In this work, we present a visual, domain-specific language for model coupling, called the Coupling Description Language, based on these interfaces. We show that it supports the resolution of model incompatibilities and allows for the fast-prototyping of coupled models.

#!The Ubuntu distribution simplifies Linux by providing a sensible collection of applications, an easy-to-use package manager, and lots of fine-tuning, which make it possibly the best Linux for desktops and laptops. Readers of both Linux Journal and TUX Magazine confirmed this by voting Ubuntu as the best Linux distribution in each publication's 2005 Readers Choice Awards. None of that simplification, however, makes Ubuntu any less fun if you're a hacker or a power user. Like all books in the "Hacks" series, Ubuntu Hacks includes 100 quick tips and tricks for all users of all technical levels. Beginners will appreciate the installation advice and tips on getting the most out of the free applications packaged with Ubuntu, while intermediate and advanced readers will learn the ins-and-outs of power management, wireless roaming, 3D video acceleration, server configuration, and much more.

#index639
#!The Internet is rife with all kinds of creepy PC bugs. In the first six months of 2004, almost 5,000 new Windows viruses and worms were discovered that were capable of compromising computer security. But the pests that users deal with aren't limited to viruses. They're plagued with everything from spam to phishing. But just because your computer is hooked up to the Internet doesn't mean your PC has to be at risk. In a constant battle of one-upmanship, the forces of good have devised a number of creative ways to fend off these Internet nasties in order to best protect your computer. And PC Pest Control from O'Reilly spells out how you can do just that. Written in a friendly, engaging manner, this handy guide covers detection, prevention and cure, where you're vulnerable, and how to surf the web more safely. It also details how you can protect yourself against adware, spyware, home page hijackers, viruses, Trojans, spam, phishing attacks, and more. For easy understanding, PC Pest Control describes each problem and its symptoms, rates the danger level, and then shows you how to solve the problem step by step. In addition, a supporting website keeps the book's content as up to date as possible, so you're always informed of the latest safeguards. And in a field that shifts as frequently as PC protection, that's a major advantage. So if you want to make sure that your personal computer doesn't fall victim to attack-or if your system has already been infected and you want to start anew-then PC Pest Control is most definitely for you.

#!The increasing proliferation of online shopping and purchasing has naturally led to a growth in the popularity of comparison-shopping search engines, popularly known as "shopbots". We extend the one-product-at-a-time search approach used in current shopbot implementations to consider purchasing plans for a bundle of items. Our approach leverages bundle-based pricing and promotional deals frequently offered by online merchants to extract substantial savings. Interestingly, our approach can also identify "freebies" that consumers can obtain at no extra cost. We also develop a model to extend the capability of the current recommendation algorithms that are mainly based on collaborative filtering and item-to-item similarity techniques, to incorporate product price and savings as an additional important factor in making recommendations to shoppers. We develop a practical algorithm that can be employed when the number of items is large or when the real-time nature of shopbot applications dictates quick response rates to consumer queries. A detailed experimental analysis with real-world data from major retailers suggests that the proposed models can provide significant savings for bundle purchasing consumers, and frequently identify freebies for consumers. Together the results underscore the potential benefits that can accrue by incorporating our models into current shopbot systems.

#t1977

#index650
#!In 1973, a project was initiated at Standard Oil of Indiana to investigate future petrochemical raw stock pricing trends. Although large in scope, the project was simple in concept: a mathematical programming model of the domestic refining industry would be subjected to projected future demand patterns for the basic olefinic and aromatic petrochemical intermediates, and the results would be used to predict industry pricing trends. In keeping with the title of this session, I am going to concentrate on the tools used for this study, rather than the study itself or its results. In fact, I could not discuss the results with you, even if I wanted to, because in the first place they are confidential and proprietary to Standard of Indiana and, in the second place, I don't know them. I guess this puts me somewhat in the position of the man who was hauled into court for returning his neighbor's lawnmower in damaged condition. In his defense, he pleaded that "in the first place, I never borrowed his lawnmower, and, in the second place, it was already busted when I picked it up, and, in the third place, it was running fine when I gave it back to him."

#!Motivated by the September 11 attacks, we are addressing the problem of policy analysis of supply-chain security. Considering the potential economic and operational impacts of inspection together with the inherent difficulty of assigning a reasonable cost to an inspection failure call for a policy analysis methodology in which stakeholders can understand the trade-offs between the diverse and potentially conflicting objectives. To obtain this information, we used a simulation-based methodology to characterize the set of Pareto optimal solutions with respect to the multiple objectives represented in the decision problem. Our methodology relies on simulation and the response surface method (RSM) to model the relationships between inspection policies and relevant stakeholder objectives in order to construct a set of Pareto optimal solutions. The approach is illustrated with an application to a real-world supply chain.

#!This paper presents a design toolbox developed for Philips Design in commission of Philips Medical Systems that provides insight into the healthcare context of rural India. Creating products for this context requires an understanding of the needs of the people within it. This paper discusses 'contextual design' through the combination of different descriptive and experiential tools, used to introduce designers into a context they are not familiar with. The toolbox has been evaluated using different performance techniques with design students. The use of role-play techniques has proven increasing relevance in many aspects: increasing the understanding and experience of participants about the context, creating an embodied and common understanding of the ideas being developed and communicating the concepts in their context.

We apply the framework to model student learning during interaction with the Adaptive Coach for Exploration (ACE) learning environment (using both interface and eye-tracking data). In addition to demonstrating framework effectiveness, we also compare results from previous research on applying the framework to a different learning environment and data type. Our results also confirm previous research on the value of using eye-tracking data to assess student learning.

#!A novel fabrication method for LIGA (from the German &#x201c;Lithographie&#x201d;, &#x201c;Galvanik&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Abformung&#x201d;) microneedles with through holes is presented. Such microneedles are in demand by most bio-medical MEMS applications and in some fluidic MEMS applications. We propose a technique that combines conventional deep X-ray lithography, plane-pattern to cross-section transfer (PCT) process, and alignment X-ray lithography. The technique provides precise hole alignment with &#x00b1;&#x00a0;3&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m tolerance. Finite-element simulations on various hole locations were performed to determine the optimum position. We previously fabricated a microneedle with a 100-&#x03bc;m base and a 300-&#x03bc;m height by a right-triangular mask. The resultant microneedle had a very sharp tip but was excessively steep, and thus resulted in a very low strength. Improved strength and tip sharpness was consequently achieved by changing the mask-pattern from a triangular pattern to a polygonal mask and changing the dimensions of the microneedle to have a 300-&#x03bc;m base with various heights between 350 and 800&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m. Using the proposed technique, we could produce a total of 100 hollow microneedles on a 5&#x00a0;&#x00d7;&#x00a0;5&#x00a0;mm2 chip. Moreover, we successfully fabricated sharpened microneedles that were stronger than that we have fabricated so far. The molding process or electroplating and the cost list of the LIGA microneedle will also be included.

#*High-capacity image hiding scheme based on vector quantization
#@Yu-Chen Hu
#t2006
#cPattern Recognition
#index681
#!A novel grayscale image hiding scheme that is capable of hiding multiple secret images into a host image of the same size is proposed in this paper. The secret images to be hidden are first compressed by vector quantization with additional index compression process. Then, the compressed secret images are encrypted and embedded into the least-significant bits of the host pixels. To provide good image quality of the stego-image, the modulus function and the image property are employed to hide the secret bits into the host pixels and determine the number of hidden bits in each host pixel, respectively. According to the results, the proposed scheme provides a higher hiding capacity and a higher degree of security than that of the virtual image cryptosystem.

#!This newest programming guide by bestselling author Jesse Liberty isn't your typical Visual Basic book. It's not a primer on the language, and it won't dull your brain with arguments hyping .NET either. Its goal, rather, is to make you immediately productive, creating Windows and Web applications using Visual Basic and its associated tools. Written for experienced Visual Basic programmers (from either a VB6 or VB .NET background), the book shows how Visual Basic 2005 can be used to rapidly build modern web applications and new "Smart Client" applications, which combine the power of individual computers with network data resources to deliver a rich interactive experience. You'll also learn the details of building robust object-oriented applications, and a host of especially dangerous pitfalls to avoid when programming with Visual Basic 2005. What makes this book different is what's not included. There's no introduction to Visual Basic, no explanation of how it fits into the .NET world. Why waste time reading about something you'll learn for yourself as soon as you start creating applications? You won't even write a "Hello World" program. With Jesse Liberty, you'll get started building something useful. The book is divided into three separate parts--Building Windows Applications, Building Web Applications, and Programming with Visual Basic--each of which could be a book on its own. The author shares his thorough understanding of the subject matter through lucid explanations and intelligently designed lessons that guide you to increasing levels of expertise. By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to program with VB 2005. Jesse Liberty's books have successfully guided thousands of programmers into the world of .NET programming, and Programming Visual Basic 2005 will be no exception. This book is sure to become a key component in the libraries of .NET developers.

#!The Carnegie Mellon In Silico Vox project seeks to move best-quality speech recognition technology from its current software-only form into a range of efficient all-hardware implementations. The central thesis is that, like graphics chips, the application is simply too performance hungry, and too power sensitive, to stay as a large software application. As a first step in this direction, we describe the design and implementation of a fully functional speech-to-text recognizer on a single Xilinx XUP platform. The design recognizes a 1000 word vocabulary, is speaker-independent, recognizes continuous (connected) speech, and is a "live mode" engine, wherein recognition can start as soon as speech input appears. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complex recognizer architecture ever fully committed to a hardware-only form. The implementation is extraordinarily small, and achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art software recognizers, while running at a fraction of the clock speed.

#!We makes use of the LoPC model, which is inspired by both the LogP/PG and BSP models but accounts for contention for message processing resources in parallel programming models to derive a general estimate of execution cost. We carry out this cost estimate analysis for three dominate programming models: message passing, shared memory and distributed shared memory. We analyze a typical application SMV multiplication written in these programming models with irregular receiver-initiated synchronous communication. The LoPC estimate for this application is shown to be reasonably accurate when compared against measured values of runtime of actual empirical computations on an SGI O2000 multiprocessor machine.

#!Emotions are of increasing interest to the HCI community. Within the last decade, emotion research in HCI grew from an eccentric hobby of some visionary scientists to a widely accepted field of research. A number of proof-of-concept prototypes and studies have been published, dedicated sensor systems and technology frameworks have been developed, and theoretical considerations have been made. While they all represent a very valuable contribution to this young field of research, they lack a common theoretical basis. Particularly, there exists no applicable model of emotions suitable for designing emotion-aware systems or performing HCI-related emotion studies. However, in order to become a mature discipline, emotion research in HCI needs such a rigorous footing that future work can be based on. In this paper, a suitable approach to structure and represent emotions for use in digital systems is introduced, after a detailed and critical review of widely used emotion models is given and representative study results are discussed. The proposed method meets several requirements of HCI researchers and software developers. It avoids artificial categorisation of emotions, requires no naming of emotional states, is language independent, and its implementation is straightforward. The results of an experiment based on this approach are discussed demonstrating its applicability.

#!We address the pose mismatch problem which can occur in face verification systems that have only a single (frontal) face image available for training. In the framework of a Bayesian classifier based on mixtures of gaussians, the problem is tackled through extending each frontal face model with artificially synthesized models for non-frontal views. The synthesis methods are based on several implementations of maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), as well as standard multi-variate linear regression (LinReg). All synthesis techniques rely on prior information and learn how face models for the frontal view are related to face models for non-frontal views. The synthesis and extension approach is evaluated by applying it to two face verification systems: a holistic system (based on PCA-derived features) and a local feature system (based on DCT-derived features). Experiments on the FERET database suggest that for the holistic system, the LinReg-based technique is more suited than the MLLR-based techniques; for the local feature system, the results show that synthesis via a new MLLR implementation obtains better performance than synthesis based on traditional MLLR. The results further suggest that extending frontal models considerably reduces errors. It is also shown that the local feature system is less affected by view changes than the holistic system; this can be attributed to the parts based representation of the face, and, due to the classifier based on mixtures of gaussians, the lack of constraints on spatial relations between the face parts, allowing for deformations and movements of face areas.

#!Fusing the scores of several biometric systems is a very promising approach to improve the overall system's accuracy. Despite many works in the literature, it is surprising that there is no coordinated effort in making a benchmark database available. It should be noted that fusion in this context consists not only of multimodal fusion, but also intramodal fusion, i.e., fusing systems using the same biometric modality but different features, or same features but using different classifiers. Building baseline systems from scratch often prevents researchers from putting more efforts in understanding the fusion problem. This paper describes a database of scores taken from experiments carried out on the XM2VTS face and speaker verification database. It then proposes several fusion protocols and provides some state-of-the-art tools to evaluate the fusion performance.

#!Turi (1991) introduced the important notion of a constrained atom&colon; an atom with associated equality and disequality constraints on its arguments. A set of constrained atoms is a constrained interpretation. We investigate how non&dash;ground representations of both the stable model semantics and the well&dash;founded semantics may be obtained through Turi&rsquo;s approach. The practical implication of this is that the well&dash;founded model (or the set of stable models) may be partially pre&dash;computed at compile&dash;time, resulting in the association of each predicate symbol in the program to a constrained atom. Algorithms to create such models are presented, both for the well founded case, and the case of stable models. Query processing reduces to checking whether each atom in the query is true in a stable model (resp. well&dash;founded model). This amounts to showing the atom is an instance of one of some constrained atom whose associated constraint is solvable. Various related complexity results are explored, and the impacts of these results are discussed from the point of view of implementing systems that incorporate the stable and well&dash;founded semantics.

#!This paper proposes a new algorithm to generate a disconnected, three-dimensional (3D) skeleton and an application of such a skeleton to generate a finite element (FE) mesh sizing function of a solid. The mesh sizing function controls the element size and the gradient, and it is crucial in generating a desired FE mesh. Here, a geometry-based mesh sizing function is generated using a skeleton. A discrete skeleton is generated by propagating a wave from the boundary towards the interior on an octree lattice of an input solid model. As the wave propagates, the distance from the boundary and direction of the wave front are calculated at the lattice-nodes (vertices) of the new front. An approximate Euclidean distance metric is used to calculate the distance traveled by the wave. Skeleton points are generated at the region where the opposing fronts meet. The distance at these skeleton points is used to measure both proximity between geometric entities and feature size, and is utilized to generate the mesh size at the lattice-nodes. The proposed octree-based skeleton is more accurate and efficient than traditional voxel-based skeleton and proves to be great tool for mesh sizing function generation.

#!With the development of distributed modeling and simulation, it is necessary for the RTI to support large-scale applications. However, many RTIs can not support largescale distributed simulations with more than 100 federates very well nowadays. StarLink+ is an RTI developed according to the IEEE 1516 standard, which can be used for large-scale simulations with thousands of federates. Great innovations are made in StarLink+, such as its architecture and inner implementation technologies. This paper presents the two-level architecture in StarLink+. The unique architecture has the advantages of both central architecture and distributed architecture. To improve the performance much more for large-scale simulations, two important technologies, i.e. multiple threads and data packing, are adopted in StarLink+. In addition, this paper explains the efficient advancing mechanism in time management and discusses the large-scale experiments with thousands of federates in StarLink+.

This in-depth tutorial not only walks you through the XQuery specification, but also teaches you how to program with this widely anticipated query language.XQuery is for query writers who have some knowledge of XML basics, but not necessarily advanced knowledge of XML-related technologies. It can be used both as a tutorial, by reading cover to cover, and as a reference, by using the comprehensive index and appendixes. Either way, you will find the background knowledge in namespaces, schemas, built-in types and regular expressions that is relevant to writing XML queries. This book provides:A high-level overview and quick tour of XQueryInformation to write sophisticated queries, without being bogged down by the details of types, namespaces, and schemasAdvanced concepts for users who want to take advantage of modularity, namespaces, typing and schemasGuidelines for working with specific types of data, such as numbers, strings, dates, URIs and processing instructionsA complete alphabetical reference to the built-in functions and typesYou will also learn about XQuery's support for filtering, sorting, and grouping data, as well as how to use FLWOR expressions, XPath, and XQuery tools for extracting and combining information. With this book, you will discover how to apply all of these tools to a wide variety of data sources, and how to recombine information from multiple sources into a single final output result.Whether you're coming from SQL, XSLT, or starting from scratch, this carefully paced tutorial takes you through the final 1.0 standard in detail.

#!We consider the problem of congestion-aware multi-path routing in the Internet. Currently, Internet routing protocols select only a single path between a source and a destination. However, due to many policy routing decisions, single-path routing may limit the achievable throughput. In this paper, we envision a scenario where multi-path routing is enabled in the Internet to take advantage of path diversity. Using minimal congestion feedback signals from the routers, we present a class of algorithms that can be implemented at the sources to stably and optimally split the flow between each source-destination pair. We then show that the connection-level throughput region of such multi-path routing/congestion control algorithms can be larger than that of a single-path congestion control scheme.

#!Society today has a wealth of information available due to information technology. The challenge facing researchers working in information access is how to help users easily locate the information needed. Evaluation methodologies and metrics are important tools to assess progress in human information interaction (HII). To properly evaluate these systems, evaluations need to consider the performance of the various components, the usability of the system, and the impact of the system on the end user. Current usability metrics are adequate for evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of such systems. Performance measures for new intelligent technologies will have to be developed. Regardless of how well the systems are and how usable the systems are, it is critical that impact measures are developed. For HII systems to be useful, we need to assess how well information analysts work with the systems. This evaluation needs to go beyond technical performance metrics and usability metrics. What are the metrics for evaluating utility? This paper describes research efforts focused on developing metrics for the intelligence community that measure the impact of new software to facilitate information interaction.

#!In this paper, we propose a convolution filtering scheme for detecting small defects in low-contrast uniform surface images and, especially, focus on the applications for backlight panels and glass substrates found in liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing. A defect embedded in a low-contrast surface image shows no distinct intensity from its surrounding region, and even worse, the sensed image may present uneven brightness on the surface. All these make the defect detection in low-contrast surface images extremely difficult. In this study, a constrained independent component analysis (ICA) model is proposed to design an optimal filter with the objective that the convolution filter will generate the most representative source intensity of the background surface without noise. The prior constraint incorporated in the ICA model confines the source values of all training image patches of a defect-free image within a small interval of control limits. In the inspection process, the same control parameter used in the constraint is also applied to set up the thresholds that make impulse responses of all pixels in faultless regions within the control limits, and those in defective regions outside the control limits. A stochastic evolutionary computation algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied to solve for the constrained ICA model. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method can effectively detect small defects in low-contrast backlight panels and LCD glass substrate images.

#!In this paper, the Simbus Backplane is used in conjunction with SAVANT/TyVIS/WARPED, a parallel VHDL simulator, and Xyce, a parallel SPICE simulation engine, to model and simulate a mixed-signal ASIC-driven charging circuit simulation. In particular, the individual components of an airbag deployment system are described and modeled in the digital and analog domains. A VHDL-based microcontroller interface is designed to control an analog charging circuit based on accelerometer output. The accelerometer and charging circuit are modeled in SPICE and interactions between the two domains are established through the Simbus Backplane. The results of this study provide evidence of the implementation possibilities available with a mixed-signal system and demonstrate the feasibility of continuing work in multi-domain simulation.

#!This paper investigates rejection strategies for unconstrained offline handwritten text line recognition. The rejection strategies depend on various confidence measures that are based on alternative word sequences. The alternative word sequences are derived from specific integration of a statistical language model in the hidden Markov model based recognition system. Extensive experiments on the IAM database validate the proposed schemes and show that the novel confidence measures clearly outperform two baseline systems which use normalised likelihoods and local n-best lists, respectively.

#!A variety of techniques for performing a spatial join are reviewed. Instead of just summarizing the literature and presenting each technique in its entirety, distinct components of the different techniques are described and each is decomposed into an overall framework for performing a spatial join. A typical spatial join technique consists of the following components: partitioning the data, performing internal-memory spatial joins on subsets of the data, and checking if the full polygons intersect. Each technique is decomposed into these components and each component addressed in a separate section so as to compare and contrast similar aspects of each technique. The goal of this survey is to describe the algorithms within each component in detail, comparing and contrasting competing methods, thereby enabling further analysis and experimentation with each component and allowing the best algorithms for a particular situation to be built piecemeal, or, even better, enabling an optimizer to choose which algorithms to use.

#!Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities at the metal-bath interface in aluminum reduction cells is an important and not fully understood topic. To simulate the two-fluid three-dimensional unstationary flow subject to a background magnetic field, a level set approach is proposed. It features a formulation in terms of the magnetic vector potential to avoid a numerical growth of the divergence of the magnetic field. The same exact projection scheme (with staggered grids) is used for both the velocity field and the magnetic vector potential. Test simulations show that the overall method behaves well in purely hydrodynamic as well as in fully magnetohydrodynamic regimes, in both cases with a single fluid and with two fluids. We also simulate with our technique the metal pad roll instability and trace the behavior of coupled interracial modes.

#!Despite growing popularity of small-scale clusters built out of off-the-shelf components, there has been little research on how these small-scale clusters behave under different scheduling policies. Batch scheduling policies with backfilling provide excellent space-sharing strategy for parallel jobs. However, as the performances of uniprocessor and symmetric multiprocessor have improved with timesharing scheduling strategies, it is intuitive that the performance of a cluster of PCs with distributed memory may also improve with time-sharing strategies, or a combination of time-sharing and space-sharing strategies. Apart from the batch scheduling policies, this research explores the possibilities of using synchronized time-sharing scheduling algorithms for clusters. This paper describes simulation of the Gang scheduling policies on top of an existing batch scheme. The simulation results indicate that time-sharing scheduler for clusters could exhibit superior performance over a batch policy.

#!As the United States' Army attempts to spiral future force technologies into the current force, realistic representations of network-centric warfare become a priority for modeling and simulation (M&S). Specifically, future communications systems will provide different performance and capabilities than current systems, and these new capabilities need to be represented by the Army's M&S. In order to enable realistic analysis, the new communications systems models will need to be loaded by realistic representations of traffic flows to ensure the accuracy of the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C4ISR) analysis results. This paper will present a design approach and a series of algorithms to implement implicit traffic in the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Simulation Environment (FSE). The paper will focus on a phased approach for the generation of implicit traffic that will realistically load the modeled communications networks as the level of explicit traffic within the simulation environment increases from a small percentage to a large percentage of overall traffic.

#!Using silhouettes in uncontrolled environments typically requires handling occlusions as well as changing or cluttered backgrounds, which limits the applicability of most silhouette based methods. For the purpose of 3-D shape modeling, we show that representing generic 3-D surfaces as implicit surfaces lets us effectively address these issues.This desirable behavior is completely independent from the way the surface deformations are parame-trized. To show this, we demonstrate our technique in three very different cases: Modeling the deformations of a piece of paper represented by an ordinary triangulated mesh; reconstruction and tracking a person's shoulders whose deformations are expressed in terms of Dirichlet Free Form Deformations; reconstructing the shape of a human face parametrized in terms of a Principal Component Analysis model.

#!A central problem in personal communication systems is to optimize bandwidth usage, while providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to mobile users. Network mobility management, and in particular, location management, consumes a significant portion of bandwidth, which is a necessary overhead for supporting mobile users. We focus our efforts on minimizing this overhead. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on optimizing existing schemes, and so the algorithms we present are easily incorporated into current networks. We present the first polynomial time approximation algorithms for minimum bandwidth location management. In planar graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses no more than a constant factor more bandwidth than the optimal solution. In general graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses just a factor O(log n) more bandwidth than optimal where n is the number of base stations in the network. We show that, in practice, our algorithm produces near-optimal results and outperforms other schemes that are described in the literature. For the important case of the line graph, we present a polynomial-time optimal algorithm. Finally, we illustrate that our algorithm can also be used for optimizing the handoff mechanism.

#!We propose a logistic regression method based on the hybridation of a linear model and product-unit neural network models for binary classification. In a first step we use an evolutionary algorithm to determine the basic structure of the product-unit model and afterwards we apply logistic regression in the new space of the derived features. This hybrid model has been applied to seven benchmark data sets and a new microbiological problem. The hybrid model outperforms the linear part and the nonlinear part obtaining a good compromise between them and they perform well compared to several other learning classification techniques. We obtain a binary classifier with very promising results in terms of classification accuracy and the complexity of the classifier.

#!We present an efficient algorithm for approximating huge general volumetric data sets, i.e. the data is given over arbitrarily shaped volumes and consists of up to millions of samples. The method is based on cubic trivariate splines, i.e. piecewise polynomials of total degree three defined w.r.t, uniform type-6 tetrahedral partitions of the volumetric domain. Similar as in the recent bivariate approximation approaches (cf. [10, 15]), the splines in three variables are automatically determined from the discrete data as a result of a two-step method (see [40]), where local discrete least squares polynomial approximations of varying degrees are extended by using natural conditions, i.e. the continuity and smoothness properties which determine the underlying spline space. The main advantages of this approach with linear algorithmic complexity are as follows: no tetrahedral partition of the volume data is needed, only small linear systems have to be solved, the local variation and distribution of the data is automatically adapted, Bernstein-B&eacute;zier techniques well-known in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) can be fully exploited, noisy data are automatically smoothed. Our numerical examples with huge data sets for synthetic data as well as some real-world data confirm the efficiency of the methods, show the high quality of the spline approximation, and illustrate that the rendered iso-surfaces inherit a visual smooth appearance from the volume approximating splines.

#!Medicine, engineering, and finance are traditional fields for the application of Fuzzy Logic (FL); however, in social sciences, the utilization of FL can be intensely explored as a valuable analysis instrument. Joining fuzzy with Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), the natural complex and uncertain criteria of social problems can be adequately explored. A suitable uncertainty analysis is the focal point in the social field. In this direction, an intelligent computational method for election forecasting is proposed as a practical result of this research. The main objective is to present a more flexible methodology for political assessment comparing to traditional methods.

#!A new approach is proposed for reconstructing 3D lines and cameras from 2D corresponding lines across multiple uncalibrated views. There is no requirement that the 2D corresponding lines on different images represent the same segment of a 3D line, which may not appear on all images. A 3D line is reconstructed by minimizing a geometric cost function that measures the distance of the reprojected end points of the 3D segment from the measured 2D lines on different images. An algorithmic procedure is provided with guaranteed convergence to a solution where the geometric cost function achieves a (local) minimum.

#@Barak Raveh,Ofer Rahat,Ronen Basri,Gideon Schreiber

#cBioinformatics
#index888
#!Motivation: Secondary structures are key descriptors of a protein fold and its topology. In recent years, they facilitated intensive computational tasks for finding structural homologues, fold prediction and protein design. Their popularity stems from an appealing regularity in patterns of geometry and chemistry. However, the definition of secondary structures is of subjective nature. An unsupervised de-novo discovery of these structures would shed light on their nature, and improve the way we use these structures in algorithms of structural bioinformatics. Methods: We developed a new method for unsupervised partitioning of undirected graphs, based on patterns of small recurring network motifs. Our input was the network of all H-bonds and covalent interactions of protein backbones. This method can be also used for other biological and non-biological networks. Results: In a fully unsupervised manner, and without assuming any explicit prior knowledge, we were able to rediscover the existence of conventional α-helices, parallel β-sheets, anti-parallel sheets and loops, as well as various non-conventional hybrid structures. The relation between connectivity and crystallographic temperature factors establishes the existence of novel secondary structures.

#!Technology plays an ever-increasing role in our everyday lives. We would like it to be a help rather than a hurdle in our work, particularly in collaborating with others. An emerging problem for both individuals and groups is information spread and neglect, where users have the same copy of the same work, stored on various conventional devices, but no way to keep track of where the most recent version resides. One type of computer support collaborative work application, groupware, tackles this problem, aiming to assist in joint authoring projects, where artifacts such as files, pictures, reports and sound are being gathered to form a whole. Such groupware systems - and we survey seven of them - vary in terms of their functional, architectural, focal, temporal, user involvement and platform dependencies. While we found a wide variety of options for each system, there were also strong commonalities. All of them work with closed communities or groups. There is no public file sharing. All users are aware of all other collaborators in the community and all systems focus on collaboration; not sharing. The comparison includes our own system Nomad, a framework for distributed resource management, with special emphasis placed on the accessibility of information stored on detached devices, such as personal computers, laptops, PDA's and flash-disks. In the comparison, Nomad has advantages of flexibility and temporal independence over the other systems, together with low requirements on the user, and a high level of mobility and platform independence. The contributions of this paper are twofold: we identify and define a specific type of CSCW, groupware, together with a set of criteria for evaluating such systems; and we survey and classify some of the main systems according to the criteria, as well as introducing a custom-designed system, Nomad. From these results, a collaborative group of workers can more easily select a specific groupware that suits its needs. Moreover, designers of new systems will find the commonality factors useful, so they can more easily position their own products.

#!In this paper, we propose a novel variational method for color image segmentation using modified geodesic active contour method. Our goal is to detect Object(s) of Interest (OOI) from a given color image, regardless of other objects. The main novelty of our method is that we modify the stopping function in the functional of usual geodesic active contour method so that the new stopping function is coupled by a discrimination function of OOI. By minimizing the functional, the OOI is segmented. Firstly, we study the pixel properties of the OOI by sample pixels visually chosen from OOI. From these sample pixels, by the principal component analysis and interval estimation, the discrimination function of whether a pixel is in the OOI is obtained probabilistically. Then we propose the energy functional for the segmentation of OOI with new stopping function. Unlike usual stopping functions defined by the image gradient, our improved stopping function depends on not only the image gradient but also the discrimination function derived from the color information of OOI. As a result, better than usual active contour methods which detect all objects in the image, our modified active contour method can detect OOI but without unwanted objects. Experiments are conducted in both synthetic and natural images. The result shows that our algorithm is very efficient for detecting OOI even the background is complicated.

#!We study the problem of image retrieval based on semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Different from traditional supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning makes use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In image retrieval, collecting labeled examples costs human efforts, while vast amounts of unlabeled data are often readily available and offer some additional information. In this paper, based on support vector machine (SVM), we introduce a semi-supervised learning method for image retrieval. The basic consideration of the method is that, if two data points are close to each, they should share the same label. Therefore, it is reasonable to search a projection with maximal margin and locality preserving property. We compare our method to standard SVM and transductive SVM. Experimental results show efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

#!Soaring health care costs and greater emphasis on preventative medicine have compelled researchers to examine new ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency in outpatient services. Extended waiting times for treatment in the outpatient department followed by short consultations has long been a complaint of patients. This issue is becoming increasingly important in Japan with its progressively aging society. In this context, a discrete event simulation model was developed to examine doctor schedule mixes (DSMs) and various appointment schedules (ASs) in a mixed-patient type environment in an outpatient department of internal medicine of a university hospital. It could identify some of the best DSMs by integrating a simulation model into an optimization program. Combining one DSM found via an optimization program with some ASs, the patient waiting time could be reduced drastically without adding extra resources.

#!In the weak form Galerkin formulation for incompressible flows, the pressure has a well-understood role. At all times, it may be interpreted as a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the divergence-free constraint on the velocity field. This is not the case in least-squares formulations for incompressible flows, where the divergence-free constraint is enforced in a least-squares sense in a variational setting of residual minimization. Thus, the role of the pressure in a least-squares formulation is rather vague. We find that this lack of velocity-pressure coupling in least-squares formulations may induce spurious temporal pressure oscillations when using the non-stationary form of the equations. We present a least-squares formulation with improved velocity-pressure coupling, based on the use of a regularized divergence-free constraint. A first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) approach based on velocity, pressure and vorticity is used to allow the use of practical C0 element expansions in the finite element model. We use high-order spectral element expansions in space and second- and third-order time stepping schemes. Excellent conservation of mass and accuracy of computed pressure metrics are demonstrated in the numerical results.

#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index930
#!In this paper, we propose a new region extraction method using chroma key with a two-tone checker pattern background. The method solves the problem in conventional chroma key techniques that foreground objects become transparent if their colors are the same as the background color. The method utilizes the adjacency condition between two-tone regions of the background and the geometrical information of the background grid line. The procedure of the proposed method consists of four steps: 1) background color extraction, 2) background grid line extraction, 3) foreground extraction, and 4) image composition. As to background color extraction, a color space approach is used. As to background grid line extraction, it is difficult to extract background grid line by a color space approach because the color of this region may be a composite of two background colors and different from them. Therefore, the background grid line is extracted from adjacency conditions between two background colors. As to foreground extraction, the boundary between the foreground and the background is detected to recheck the foreground region whose color is same as the background, and the background region whose color is same as the foreground. To detect regions whose colors are same as the background, the adjacency conditions with the background grid line are utilized. As to image composition, the process that smoothes the color of the foreground's boundary against the new background is carried out to create natural images. Experimental results show that the foreground objects can be segmented exactly from the background regardless of the colors of the foreground objects.

#!The PDES literature offers a rich set of techniques for distributed and efficient simulation. However, there is a growing need for simulators that support agent-based applications, and PDES systems are not always well suited for these applications. Example agent-based applications include simulation of biological systems such as ants and bees, multi-robot systems and battlefield simulations. The robotics research community has developed agent-based simulators that provide useful APIs for agent applications. However, such simulators have performance limitations, and they do not scale well. Our approach is to provide middleware between an agent-based API and a PDES simulation kernel. The result is a simulation system that offers an agent-based API for the programmer to a high performance PDES system. Here we describe our design and initial implementation of SASSY, the Scalable Agents Simulation System. We describe our initial implementation and compare the design with related approaches.

#!This paper presents a Time Warp fossil collection mechanism that functions without need for a GVT estimation algorithm. Effectively each Logical Process (LP) collects causality information during normal event execution and then each LP utilizes this information to identify fossils. In this mechanism, LPs use constant size vectors (that are independent of the total number of parallel simulation objects) as timestamps called Plausible Total Clocks to disseminate causality information. For proper operation, this mechanism requires that the communication layer preserves a FIFO ordering on messages. A detailed description of this new fossil collection mechanism and its proof of correctness is presented in this paper.

#!A simple and general-purpose system to recognize biological particles is presented. It is composed of four stages: First (if necessary) promising locations in the image are detected and small regions containing interesting samples are extracted using a feature finder. Second, differential invariants of the brightness are computed at multiple scales of resolution. Third, after point-wise non-linear mappings to a higher dimensional feature space, this information is averaged over the whole region thus producing a vector of features for each sample that is invariant with respect to rotation and translation. Fourth, each sample is classified using a classifier obtained from a mixture-of-Gaussians generative model. This system was developed to classify 12 categories of particles found in human urine; it achieves a 93.2% correct classification rate in this application. It was subsequently trained and tested on a challenging set of images of airborne pollen grains where it achieved an 83% correct classification rate for the three categories found during one month of observation. Pollen classification is challenging even for human experts and this performance is considered good.

#!Motivation: Functional analyses based on the association of Gene Ontology (GO) terms to genes in a selected gene list are useful bioinformatic tools and the GOstats package has been widely used to perform such computations. In this paper we report significant improvements and extensions such as support for conditional testing. Results: We discuss the capabilities of GOstats, a Bioconductor package written in R, that allows users to test GO terms for over or under-representation using either a classical hypergeometric test or a conditional hypergeometric that uses the relationships among GO terms to decorrelate the results. Availability: GOstats is available as an R package from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.org Contact: sfalcon@fhcrc.org

#!The synthesis of increased global competitiveness and the acceptance of commercially available multi purpose database management systems (DBMS) for decision support applications requires an ever more critical system evaluation and selection to be completed in a progressively short period of time. Designers of standard benchmarks, individual customer benchmarks and system stress tests alike are struggling to mastermind queries that are both representative to the real world and execute in a reasonable time. Additionally, the enriched functionality of every new DBMS release amplifies the complexity of today's decision support systems calling for a novel approach in query generation for benchmarks. This paper proposes a framework of so called query evolution rules that can be applied to typical decision support queries, written in SQL92. Deployed in combination with QGEN2, the query generator developed by the TPC for TPC-DS ?[13], these rules quickly turn a small set of queries into a large set of semantically similar queries for ad-hoc benchmarking purposes or they can be used to generate thousands of queries quickly to stress test optimizers or query execution engines without much user intervention.

Initially most effort was directed at building the host processor, EMMY, and its support tools. The next stage was to emulate a variety of instruction sets --- building an archive of emulators. Now we have well over a dozen emulators and can add a new one quickly. A student can emulate a know image architecture in about ten weeks --- twenty weeks includes verification and documentation --- thirty weeks for I/O and interface to a simple operating system. (A student-week is about 6 - 8 hours of effort and corresponds to three units of credit.)

#*A new metric for measuring metamodels quality-of-fit for deterministic simulations

#!Metamodels are used to provide simpler prediction means than the complex simulation models they approximate. Accuracy of a metamodel is one fundamental criterion that is used as the basis for accepting or rejecting a metamodel. Average-based metrics such as root-mean-square error RMSE and R-square are often used. Like all other average-based statistics, these measures are sensitive to sample sizes unless the number of test points in these samples is adequate. We introduce in this paper a new metric that can be used to measure metamodels fit quality, called metamodel acceptability score MAS. The proposed metric gives readily interpretable meaning to metamodels acceptability. Furthermore, initial studies show that MAS is less sensitive to test sample sizes compared to average-based validation measures.

#!Automatic creation of B-rep models of engineering objects from freehand sketches would benefit designers. A subgoal is to take a single line drawing (with hidden lines removed), and from it deduce an initial 3D geometric realisation of the visible part of the object. Junction and line labels, and provisional depth coordinates, are important components of this frontal geometry. Most methods for producing frontal geometry use line labelling, but this takes little or no account of geometry. As a result, the line labels produced can be unreliable.Previously, we proposed an approach which inflates a drawing to produce provisional depth coordinates, and uses these to make deductions about line labels. Even a na&iuml;ve implementation can outperform previous line labelling methods in certain cases. In this paper, we further enhance this approach. We extend the algorithm to non-isometric-projection drawings, consider improved ways of realising some of the concepts, and also consider how to combine this approach with other labelling techniques to gain the benefits of each.We test our approach using to be drawings of what we consider representative samples of engineering objects; these exemplify difficulties not considered in many previous papers on line labelling. Our results, based on this test set, show that the enhancements result in significant benefits.

#!The most recent advances in external bone remodeling are shown using strain energy density (SED) and damage mechanics variables as stimulus functions. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to obtain the tractions and displacements in each iteration.In this paper it is assumed that the level of damage and the strain energy near the periosteum and endosteum control the external bone remodeling response in the cortical of long bones. The boundary is modified as a function of time and the numerical analysis is solved through the method before mentioned for each variation of the boundary coordinates, then the geometry is evaluated and adapted. Smoothing techniques are used ([β-spline surfaces) to prevent sudden variations in the boundary that may hinder a solution convergence. To validate this model a numerical example is shown with previously validated experimental data from other authors.

#!We present a novel approach for interactively synthesizing motions for characters navigating in complex environments. We focus on the runtime efficiency for motion generation, thereby enabling the interactive animation of a large number of characters simultaneously. The key idea is to precompute search trees of motion clips that can be applied to arbitrary environments. Given a navigation goal relative to a current body position, the best available solution paths and motion sequences can be efficiently extracted during runtime through a series of table lookups. For distant start and goal positions, we first use a fast coarse-level planner to generate a rough path of intermediate sub-goals to guide each iteration of the runtime lookup phase.We demonstrate the efficiency of our technique across a range of examples in an interactive application with multiple autonomous characters navigating in dynamic environments. Each character responds in real-time to arbitrary user changes to the environment obstacles or navigation goals. The runtime phase is more than two orders of magnitude faster than existing planning methods or traditional motion synthesis techniques. Our technique is not only useful for autonomous motion generation in games, virtual reality, and interactive simulations, but also for animating massive crowds of characters offline for special effects in movies.

#!Given a sequence of n real numbers and an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1/2n(n - 1), the k maximum-sum segments problem is to locate the k segments whose sums are the k largest among all possible segment sums. Recently, Bengtsson and Chen gave an O(min{k + n log2 n, n√k})-time algorithm for this problem. Bae and Takaoka later proposed a more efficient algorithm for small k. In this paper, we propose an O(n + k log(min{n, k}))-time algorithm for the same problem, which is superior to both of them when k is o(n log n). We also give the first optimal algorithm for delivering the k maximum-sum segments in non-decreasing order if k ≤ n. Then we develop an O(n2d-1 + k log min{n, k})-time algorithm for the d-dimensional version of the problem, where d > 1 and each dimension, without loss of generality, is of the same size n. This improves the best previously known O(n2d-1C)-time algorithm, also by Bengtsson and Chen, where C = min{k + n log2 n, n√k}. It should be pointed out that, given a two-dimensional array of size m × n, our algorithm for finding the k maximum-sum subarrays is the first one achieving cubic time provided that k is O(m2n/log n).

#!A re-scan of the well-known Mach band illusion has led to the proposal of a Bi-Laplacian of Gaussian operation in early vision. Based on this postulate, the human visual system at low-level has been modeled from two approaches that give rise to two new tools. On one hand, it leads to the construction of a new image sharpening kernel, and on the other, to the explanation of more complex brightness-contrast illusions and the possible development of a new algorithm for robust visual capturing and display systems.

#!Use different real positive numbers p"i to represent all kinds of pattern categories, after mapping the inputted patterns into a special feature space by a non-linear mapping, a linear relation between the mapped patterns and numbers p"i is assumed, whose bias and coefficients are undetermined, and the hyper-plane corresponding to zero output of the linear relation is looked as the base hyper-plane. To determine the pending parameters, an objective function is founded aiming to minimize the difference between the outputs of the patterns belonging to a same type and the corresponding p"i, and to maximize the distance between any two different hyper-planes corresponding to different pattern types. The objective function is same to that of support vector regression in form, so the coefficients and bias of the linear relation are calculated by some known methods such as SVM^l^i^g^h^t approach. Simultaneously, three methods are also given to determine p"i, the best one is to determine them in training process, which has relatively high accuracy. Experiment results of the IRIS data set show that, the accuracy of this method is better than those of many SVM-based multi-class classifiers, and close to that of DAGSVM (decision-directed acyclic graph SVM), emphatically, the recognition speed is the highest.

#!The growth of different network architectures to connect wireless sensors for monitoring physical environments has become an important application area. Chief issues related to such systems include: (a) the permanence of environment monitoring, (b) the mobility management of sensors, (c) the adhoc communication method, and (d) the security of responsive messages. This paper presents an ad-hoc architecture and communication and mobility schemes to offer an efficient monitoring system in an environment where targets have unpredicted motion. Moreover, it introduces a security solution. The paper concludes by presenting the simulation results in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

#!The realistic simulation modeling becomes very essential and effective for designing and managing of manufacturing systems, which needs to be addressed manufacturing dynamics. This research includes manufacturing uncertainties in the form of simulation intelligence to improve the system's performance in the high-mix low-volume manufacturing systems. It shows how simulation modeling can be used to evaluate alternative designs in a dynamic uncertain manufacturing environment. Fuzzy rule based machine, labor and logistics uncertainties are addressed in this study. A combination of product mix and production volume is analyzed using intelligent simulation model for an optimal designing of the production system to meet future customer demands. Intelligent knowledge system shows significant close to real-life scenario. The proposed intelligent simulation modeling is validated with real life application.

#!This IBM Redbook provides an introduction to the IBM SOA Foundation, and includes a detailed implementation example for the Service Creation scenario. Part 1. "Getting started with IBM SOA Foundation,” includes an introduction to SOA from a business and architecture perspective. We describe the key elements of the IBM SOA Foundation, including the SOA life cycle, logical architecture, and SOA scenarios. Next we describe the Service Creation scenario in more detail since this is the focus of redbook example. We describe best practices and guidelines for SOA. In addition, we include a process for applying the SOA scenarios and patterns. Part 2 "Service Creation scenario example,” provides an end-to-end working example representative of the Service Creation scenario. We start by modeling the business requirements of a fictitious car rental company that has an existing J2EE based application. We demonstrate how to identify services using SOMA, and use a process for applying the SOA scenarios and reusable patterns to accelerate the creation of a solution architecture. The remaining chapters provide the implementation details to assemble using Rational Application Developer V6.0.1, deploy using WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment V6.0.2, and manage the solution using Tivoli Composite Application Manager for SOA V6.0.

#!Member-maintained communities ask their users to perform tasks the community needs. From Slashdot, to IMDb, to Wikipedia, groups with diverse interests create community-maintained artifacts of lasting value (CALV) that support the group's main purpose and provide value to others. Said communities don't help members find work to do, or do so without regard to individual preferences, such as Slashdot assigning meta-moderation randomly. Yet social science theory suggests that reducing the cost and increasing the personal value of contribution would motivate members to participate more.We present SuggestBot, software that performs intelligent task routing (matching people with tasks) in Wikipedia. SuggestBot uses broadly applicable strategies of text analysis, collaborative filtering, and hyperlink following to recommend tasks. SuggestBot's intelligent task routing increases the number of edits by roughly four times compared to suggesting random articles. Our contributions are: 1) demonstrating the value of intelligent task routing in a real deployment; 2) showing how to do intelligent task routing; and 3) sharing our experience of deploying a tool in Wikipedia, which offered both challenges and opportunities for research.

They know the fastest, smartest, and most efficient way to do just about everything. In short, they know all the "tricks of the trade." And now, you can too.This book is packed cover-to-cover, wall-to-wall with nothing but those cool little inside tips that can make you faster, better, and have more fun using Adobe InDesign CS2. There are no detailed descriptions on working with hyphenation dictionaries, or long boring discussions on color workflow, it's just tips--short, sweet, and to the point.So why just tips? When we (you, me, etc.) look at books, if we see the word "Tip" we're all immediately drawn to it. That's because we know we're about to learn something really cool. Maybe it's an undocumented keyboard shortcut, a hidden inside secret, or just a faster, better way to do something we do every day. The only problem with the tips in these books is there's never enough of 'em. That is, until now.We wanted to create a book that is nothing but these tips, hundreds of tips, but with the added bonus that each tip would have a full color graphic along with it, showing you exactly how it's done. Most importantly, to get in this book they've got to be "Killer Tips." The kind of tip that makes you smile, nod, and then call all your friends and "tune them up" with your new status as InDesign guru.This book is your ticket to working faster and smarter in Adobe InDesign CS2 than you ever thought you could, and best of all, you'll have a blast doing it.

#!Many factors currently influence the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) workforce, including the drive for return to flight, a stated Shuttle Program end date of 2010, and the Vision for Space Exploration which calls for the development of a new launch vehicle. Additionally, external factors such as cost of living in Central Florida, availability of skilled technical hires, and unemployment rate affect the overall workforce climate. Managing human capital in a manner consistent with safety and mission success, and to strategically position the center to execute its future mission, it is necessary to understand how these different influencing factors work together to produce an overall workforce climate. We have been using System Dynamics models to capture some of these factors. These models are also the starting point of agent-based models which can capture particular features not possible with the original system dynamics models. This paper introduces our simulation modeling efforts.

#!Motion capture data is now widely available to create realistic character animation. However, it is difficult to reuse without any additional information. For this reason, annotating motion data with kinematic constraints is a clever step to ease further operations such as blending or motion editing. Unfortunately, prior automatic methods prove to be unreliable for noisy data and/or lack genericity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting kinematic constraints for motion data. It detects when an object (or an end-effector) is stationary in space or is rotating around an axis or a point. Our method is fast, generic and may be used on any kind of objects in the scene. Furthermore, it is robust to highly noisy data as we detect and reject aberrant data by using a least median of squares (LMedS) method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method in various motion editing contexts.

#!Valid models of the WWW are important for creating WWW-like representations, upon which new algorithms and applications for searching, indexing, compression etc. can be tested, but also for predicting the evolution of the web and the emergence of important new phenomena. In this study we introduce a validation process for web-graph models and use it to analyze the behavior of the Exponential Growth Copying Model, which has been explicitly designed to model the WWW. We study the effect of individual parameters on its effectiveness, suggest appropriate parameter values for the creation of web-like graphs and indicate inherent deficiencies of the model.

#!WDM optical networks provide unprecedented high speed and reliability for message transfer among the nodes. All-to-all routing is a fundamental routing problem in such networks and has been well studied on single hop WDM networks. However, the number of wavelengths to realize all-to-all routing on the single hop model typically is very large. One way to reduce the number of wavelengths is to use k-hop routing, in which each routing path consists of k segments and each segment is assigned a different wavelength, where k usually is a small constant. Because of the complexity of design and analysis for such a routing problem, only few papers discussed and proposed all-to-all routing by k ≥ 2 hops. However, the proposed algorithms are usually exceeding complicated even for ring topologies. Often, an ad hoc approach is employed to deal with each individual topology.In this paper we propose a generic method for all-to-all routing in multi-hop WDM networks, which aims to minimize the number of wavelengths. We illustrate the approach for several optical networks of commonly used topology, including lines, rings, tori, meshes, and complete binary trees. For each case an upper bound on the number of wavelengths is obtained. The results show that this approach produces clear routing paths, requires less wavelengths, and can easily incorporate load balancing. For simple topologies such as lines and rings, this approach easily produces the same bounds on the number of wavelengths that were hard-obtained previously. Moreover, this general approach provides a unified routing algorithm for any d-dimensional torus, which seems impossible to obtain by the previous approach.

#!This paper presents a new and powerful heterogeneous solid modeling paradigm for representing, modeling, and rendering of multi-dimensional, physical attributes across any volumetric objects. The modeled solid can be of complicated geometry and arbitrary topology. It is formulated using a trivariate simplex spline defined over a tetrahedral decomposition of any 3D domain. Heterogeneous material attributes associated with solid geometry can be modeled and edited by manipulating the control vectors and/or associated knots of trivariate simplex splines easily. The multiresolution capability is achieved by interactively subdividing any regions of interest and allocating more knots and control vectors accordingly. We also develop a feature-sensitive fitting algorithm that can reconstruct a more compact, continuous trivariate simplex spline from structured or unstructured volumetric grids. This multiresolution representation results from the adaptive and progressive tetrahedralization of the 3D domain. In addition, based on the simplex spline theory, we derive several theoretical formula and propose a fast direct rendering algorithm for interactive data analysis and visualization of the simplex spline volumes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm augments the current modeling and visualization techniques with the new and unique advantages.

#!To make the best use of the resources in a shared grid environment, an application scheduler must make a prediction of available performance on each resource. In this paper, we examine the problem of predicting available CPU performance in time-shared grid system. We present and evaluate a new and innovative method to predict the one-step-ahead CPU load in a grid. Our prediction strategy forecasts the future CPU load based on the variety tendency in several past steps and in previous similar patterns, and uses a polynomial fitting method. Our experimental results on large load traces collected from four different kinds of machines demonstrate that this new prediction strategy achieves average prediction errors which are between 22% and 86% less than those incurred by four previous methods.

#!This paper presents simple and deterministic algorithms for partial point set pattern matching in 2D. Given a set P of n points, called sample set, and a query set Q of k points (n>=k), the problem is to find a matching of Q with a subset of P under rigid motion. The match may be of two types: exact and approximate. If an exact matching exists, then each point in Q coincides with the corresponding point in P under some translation and/or rotation. For an approximate match, some translation and/or rotation may be allowed such that each point in Q lies in a predefined @e-neighborhood region around some point in P. The proposed algorithm for the exact matching needs O(n^2) space and O(n^2logn) preprocessing time. The existence of a match for a given query set Q can be checked in O(k@alogn) time in the worst-case, where @a is the maximum number of equidistant pairs of point in P. For a set of n points, @a may be O(n^4^/^3) in the worst-case. Some applications of the partial point set pattern matching are then illustrated. Experimental results on random point sets and some fingerprint databases show that, in practice, the computation time is much smaller than the worst-case requirement. The algorithm is then extended for checking the exact match of a set of k line segments in the query set with a k-subset of n line segments in the sample set under rigid motion in O(knlogn) time. Next, a simple version of the approximate matching problem is studied where one point of Q exactly matches with a point of P, and each of the other points of Q lie in the @e-neighborhood of some point of P. The worst-case time and space complexities of the proposed algorithm are O(n^2k^2logn) and O(n), respectively. The proposed algorithms will find many applications to fingerprint matching, image registration, and object recognition.

#!In this paper, we describe the compiler developed to target the Molen reconfigurable processor and programming paradigm. The compiler automatically generates optimized binary code for C applications, based on pragma annotation of the code executed on the reconfigurable hardware. For the IBM PowerPC 405 processor included in the Virtex II Pro platform FPGA, we implemented code generation, register, and stack frame allocation following the PowerPC EABI (embedded application binary interface). The PowerPC backend has been extended to generate the appropriate instructions for the reconfigurable hardware and data transfer, taking into account the information of the specific hardware implementations and system. Starting with an annotated C application, a complete design flow has been integrated to generate the executable bitstream for the reconfigurable processor. The flexible design of the proposed infrastructure allows to consider the special features of the reconfigurable architectures. In order to hide the reconfiguration latencies, we implemented an instruction-scheduling algorithm for the dynamic hardware configuration instructions. The algorithm schedules, in advance, the hardware configuration instructions, taking into account the conflicts for the reconfigurable hardware resources (FPGA area) between the hardware operations. To verify the Molen compiler, we used the multimedia video frame M-JPEG encoder of which the extended discrete cosine transform (DCT&ast;) function was mapped on the FPGA. We obtained an overall speedup of 2.5 (about 84&percnt; efficiency over the maximal theoretical speedup of 2.96). The performance efficiency is achieved using automatically generated nonoptimized DCT&ast; hardware implementation. The instruction-scheduling algorithm has been tested for DCT, quantization, and VLC operations. Based on simulation results, we determine that, while a simple scheduling produces a significant performance decrease, our proposed scheduling contributes for up to 16x M-JPEG encoder speedup.

#!Many military planning problems are difficult to solve using pure mathematical programming techniques. One such problem is scheduling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military operations subject to dynamic movement and control constraints. This problem is instead formulated as a dynamic programming problem whose approximate solution is obtained via the Assignment Scheduling Capability for UAVs (ASC-U) model using concepts from both simulation and optimization. Optimization is very effective at identifying the best decision for static problems, but is weaker in identifying the best decision in dynamic systems. Simulation is very effective in modeling and capturing dynamic effects, but is weak in optimizing from alternatives. ASC-U exploits the relative strengths of both methodologies by periodically re-optimizing UAV assignments and then having the simulation transition the states according to state dynamics. ASC-U thus exploits the strengths of simulation and optimization to construct good, timely solutions that neither optimization nor simulation could achieve alone.

#!This paper considers the problem that arises when a vehicle carrying nuclear material is detected approaching a border crossing. As quickly as possible, and with automation we wish to identify which vehicle among all those in the area is likely to be carrying the source. We show that if the border crossing area has technology for tracking the position of vehicles, we can correlate observed movements with observed changes in levels of detected radiation---for as the vehicle carrying the material gets closer to the detector, the stronger will be the detected radiation. We use a simulation model that captures the stop-and-go dynamics of a border crossing area to evaluate our ideas, and find a highly successful technique that tracks which vehicles move just when detected radiation changes, coupled with fitting radiation intensity/distance observations to an inverse-square law. This method almost always isolates the sought vehicle just as soon as the minimum number of data observations is obtained.

#!Many databases contain uncertain and imprecise references to real-world entities. The absence of identifiers for the underlying entities often results in a database which contains multiple references to the same entity. This can lead not only to data redundancy, but also inaccuracies in query processing and knowledge extraction. These problems can be alleviated through the use of entity resolution. Entity resolution involves discovering the underlying entities and mapping each database reference to these entities. Traditionally, entities are resolved using pairwise similarity over the attributes of references. However, there is often additional relational information in the data. Specifically, references to different entities may cooccur. In these cases, collective entity resolution, in which entities for cooccurring references are determined jointly rather than independently, can improve entity resolution accuracy. We propose a novel relational clustering algorithm that uses both attribute and relational information for determining the underlying domain entities, and we give an efficient implementation. We investigate the impact that different relational similarity measures have on entity resolution quality. We evaluate our collective entity resolution algorithm on multiple real-world databases. We show that it improves entity resolution performance over both attribute-based baselines and over algorithms that consider relational information but do not resolve entities collectively. In addition, we perform detailed experiments on synthetically generated data to identify data characteristics that favor collective relational resolution over purely attribute-based algorithms.

#!In fingerprint verification systems, there are usually multiple (from two to four) enrolled impressions for a same finger. The performance of the systems can be improved by combining these impressions through feature fusion or decision fusion strategy. In this paper, different schemes to combine multiple enrolled impressions are comparatively studied. Experimental results show that a larger improvement can be obtained by using decision fusion scheme than feature fusion. In all decision fusion rules, sum rule outperforms voting rule a little whether using similarity or Neyman-Pearson rule. Based on the observation that the performance of these two strategies can complement each other, we also propose a novel fusion scheme to further combine feature fusion and decision fusion, which can produce an even better result.

#!This paper presents a connection handoff interface between the operating system and the network interface. Using this interface, the operating system can offload a subset of TCP connections in the system to the network interface, while the remaining connections are processed on the host CPU. Offloading can reduce computation and memory bandwidth requirements for packet processing on the host CPU. However, full TCP offloading may degrade system performance because finite processing and memory resources on the network interface limit the amount of packet processing and the number of connections. Using handoff, the operating system controls the number of offloaded connections in order to fully utilize the network interface without overloading it. Handoff is transparent to the application, and the operating system may choose to offload connections to the network interface or reclaim them from the interface at any time. A prototype system based on the modified FreeBSD operating system shows that handoff reduces the number of instructions and cache misses on the host CPU. As a result, the number of CPU cycles spent processing each packet decreases by 16--84%. Simulation results show handoff can improve web server throughput (SEPCweb99) by 15%, despite short-lived connections.

The differences between these groups translate into specific network requirements. Within some organizations, these requirements are so dissimilar that the different groups need to be treated as totally separate customers by the enterprise's IT department. As the number of groups increases, keeping them separate and secure is a challenge to IT departments, particularly with the advent of wireless networks, the requirement for enterprise-wide user mobility, and the need for cross group collaboration with resource sharing on a per project basis. Network Virtualization provides design guidance for virtualized enterprise networks and arms network architects with the background necessary to make sound technological choices in the face of different business requirements. As a means of introduction, Network Virtualization lays out the fundamentals of enterprise network design. The book builds upon these fundamental principles to introduce the different virtualization methods as the logical evolution of the enterprise network architecture. Detailed descriptions of the technology, design principles, network configurations, and real-world case studies are provided throughout the book, helping readers develop a pragmatic understanding of virtualized enterprise network architectures. Specific examples are included that tailor deployment advice to the small, medium, and large enterprise environment.

#!Fusion of sensor and communication data currently can only be performed at a late processing stage after sensor and textual information are formulated as logical statements at appropriately high level of abstraction. Contrary to this it seems, the human mind integrates sensor and language signals seamlessly, before signals are understood, at pre-conceptual level. Learning of conceptual contents of the surrounding world depends on language and vice versa. The paper describes a mathematical technique for such integration. It combines fuzzy dynamic logic with dual cognitive-language models. The paper briefly discusses relationships between the proposed mathematical technique, working of the mind and applications to understanding-based search engines.

#!Based on the recently published point symmetry distance (PSD) measure, this paper presents a novel PSD measure, namely symmetry similarity level (SSL) operator for K-means algorithm. Our proposed modified point symmetry-based K-means (MPSK) algorithm is more robust than the previous PSK algorithm by Su and Chou. Not only the proposed MPSK algorithm is suitable for the symmetrical intra-clusters as the PSK algorithm does, the proposed MPSK algorithm is also suitable for the symmetrical inter-clusters. In addition, two speedup strategies are presented to reduce the time required in the proposed MPSK algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the significant execution-time improvement and the extension to the symmetrical inter-clusters of the proposed MPSK algorithm when compared to the previous PSK algorithm.

#!Computer simulation models will ideally be developed within an environment where all the necessary input data is readily available and all the relevant stakeholders are supportive and co-operative. In practice, many models are developed for the purpose of evaluating organisational or process change. As a result, system performance data may often be limited or potentially biased by key parties associated with the results of the simulation model. Ensuring valid input data is therefore a key aspect of model validation and an important component in a successful simulation study. This paper addresses some examples of data collection problems that have been encountered by the author and presents a number of lessons identified.

#!A remote user authentication scheme is a two-party protocol whereby an authentication server in a distributed system confirms the identity of a remote individual logging on to the server over an untrusted, open network. Recently, Lee et al. have proposed an efficient nonce-based scheme for remote user authentication using smart cards. This work reviews Lee et al.'s authentication scheme and provides a security analysis on the scheme. Our analysis shows that Lee et al.'s scheme does not achieve its basic aim of authenticating remote users and furthermore has a very hazardous method for changing passwords. In addition, we recommend some changes to the scheme so that it can attain at least its main security goal.

#!Intel's Fab-18 is based in Israel, and has transitioned from producing 0.18-micron logic devices to producing 90nM flash products. During this transition period, the factory has de-ramped in volume of logic while ramping-up flash. AutoSched AP software was utilized for the development of a transient simulation model of the Fab's behavior during this period. It is the first attempt, at Intel, to utilize a full factory simulation in order to analyze and support decisions that pertain to a transient period of parallel de-ramp and ramp-up of technologies. Unlike typical simulation models for the analysis of factory performance and behavior in steady-state, the transient model poses several modeling challenges and requires major adjustments in dealing with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss those aspects. The benefits and contribution of such a model to decision making and the improvement of factory performance are also presented.

#!In many real-world optimization problems, the objective function may come from a simulation evaluation so that it is (a) subject to various levels of noise, (b) not differentiable, and (c) computationally hard to evaluate. In this paper, we modify Powell's UOBYQA algorithm to handle those real-world simulation problems. Our modifications apply Bayesian techniques to guide appropriate sampling strategies to estimate the objective function. We aim to make the underlying UOBYQA algorithm proceed efficiently while simultaneously controlling the amount of computational effort.

With the wide use of ontologies their integration, design, and evolution becomes an important problem. We show how textmining on relevant text corpora can be used to identify matching ontology terms of two separate ontologies and to propose new ontology terms for a given term. We evaluate these approaches on the GeneOntology.

The verified implementation stores terms as directed acyclic graphs by means of a pointer structure. Its time complexity is $O(n^2)$ and its space complexity $O(n)$ , and it can be executed in ACL2 at a speed comparable to a similar C implementation. We report the main issues encountered to achieve this formally verified implementation.

#!Diffusion processes, and their discrete time counterparts, random walk models, have demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioural decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviourally-derived diffusion models of decision making.This article bridges the expanse between the neurophysiological and behavioural decision making literatures specifically, decision field theory [Busemeyer, J. R. & Townsend, J. T. (1993). Decision field theory: A dynamic-cognitive approach to decision making in an uncertain environment. Psychological Review, 100, 432-459], a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, is presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics. Potential neural correlates of this model are proposed, and relevant competing models are also addressed.

#!Performance is an important attribute of a software system. To develop a software system of acceptable performance, the team needs to specify precise performance requirements, design appropriate test cases, and use suitable techniques to analyze the performance characteristics. However, the lack of a structured framework for performance engineering may impair the effectiveness of the techniques. We propose the Performance Refinement and Evolution Model (PREM) as a performance management framework. Based on the specification of quantitative measurement and workloads, PREM classifies performance requirements specification, analysis activities, and testing into four levels. In this paper, we provide an overview of this model.

#!In the dynamic environment of semiconductor manufacturing operations, a bottleneck could be created at the bake furnaces of the deposition loop as capacity expands. Upgrading of the bake furnaces by adding a lot-per-batch in the boat or purchasing a new furnace are two possible solutions to this problem. A simulation model was constructed to assist the decision making, with the behavior of the wet benches (upstream tools) and cluster tools (downstream tools) being modeled in detail. We concluded that a limited number of furnaces upgrade is sufficient to sustain the capacity expansion. But the bottleneck was shifted to an upstream tool, which required the backup tool to be activated to manage the queue. A loading policy that constrains batches to queue at maximum time before loading into the furnaces has to be implemented to balance the efficiency at the furnaces and their downstream tools, without compromising on the cycle time.

#!Determining optimal subspace projections that can maintain task-relevant information in the data is an important problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric nonlinear subspace projection technique that maintains class separability maximally under the Shannon mutual information (MI) criterion. Employing kernel density estimates for nonparametric estimation of MI makes possible an interesting marriage of kernel density estimation-based information theoretic methods and kernel machines, which have the ability to determine nonparametric nonlinear solutions for difficult problems in machine learning. Significant computational savings are achieved by translating the definition of the desired projection into the kernel-induced feature space, which leads to obtain analytical solution.

#!This paper describes an approach based on evolutionary algorithms, HIDER (HIerarchical DEcision Rules), for learning rules in continuous and discrete domains. The algorithm produces a hierarchical set of rules, that is, the rules are sequentially obtained and must be therefore tried in order until one is found whose conditions are satisfied. Due to the computational cost of the evolutionary algorithms, we have developed a preprocesing method to reduce the number of examples from the database. This method, named EOP (Editing by Ordered Projections), has some interesting characteristics, especially from the point of view of the application of axis&dash;parallel classifiers. We have tested our system on real data from the UCI Repository, and the results of a 10&dash;fold cross&dash;validation are compared to C4.5's and C4.5Rules'. The experiments showed that HIDER works well in practice.

#!This paper proposes a novel edge detection method for both gray level images and color images. The 3x3 mask in the image is considered and two pixel sets S"0 and S"1 in the mask are used to define an objective function. The values of the objective function corresponding to four directions determine the edge intensity and edge direction of each pixel in the mask. After all pixels in the image have been processed, the edge map and direction map are generated. Then we apply the non-maxima suppression method to the edge map and the direction map to extract the edge points. The proposed method can detect the edge successfully, while double edges, thick edges, and speckles can be avoided.

#!The objective of this paper is to present the development of a simulation model involving materials handling in a large steel company from Arcelor Group. The project had a return of more than 2 million USD and points to a kind of application that seems to be a typical case where static analysis may cause great errors comparing to a dynamic one (because the results were also observed in another Brazilian steel company). The project focused in the processes involving pig iron transportation between the blast furnaces and its discharge in the steelmaking plant. It allowed the evaluation of several operational parameters such as for the 7.5 Mt/year production rhythm, a great increase from the actual production of 5 Mt/year. "Bottlenecks" in the flow were identified through the results and the scenarios gave the support to the decision of increasing the number of torpedo-cars and locomotives in the system.

#index1355
#!Pervasive computing environments introduce new requirements in expressiveness and flexibility of access control policies which are almost addressable leveraging contextual information. Although context-awareness augments the expressiveness of policies, it increases the probability of arising conflicts. Generally, context-aware authorizations are defined using some contextual constraints on the involved entities in an access request. Accordingly, principles like "more specific overrides", which are employed to resolve possible conflicts, are required to consider the contextual constraints. In this paper, we formalize the use of context constraints in a typical context-aware multi-authority policy model; each authority is capable of defining an expressive conflict resolution policy leveraging context-based precedence establishment principles. Based on the policy model, we propose a comprehensive graph-based approach to resolve conflicts. The strength of the approach is that conflict detection which requires context-based inference is almost done statically and resolution is left for run-time.

#!Providing data availability in a high performance computing environment is very important, especially in this data-intensive world. Most clusters either equip with RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) devices or use redundant nodes to protect data from loss. However, neither of these can really solve the reliability problem incurred in a striped file system. Striping provides an efficient way to increase I/O throughput both in the distributed and parallel paradigms. But it also reduces the overall reliability of a disk system by N fold, where N is the number of independent disks in the system. Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS) is an open source parallel file system which has been widely used in the Linux environment. Its striping structure is good for performance but provides no fault tolerance. We implement Reliable Parallel File System (RPFS) based on PVFS but with reliability support. Our quantitative analysis shows that MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) of our RPFS is better than that of PVFS. Besides, we propose a parity cache table (PCT) to alleviate the penalty of parity updating. The evaluation of our RPFS shows that its read performance is almost the same as that of PVFS (2% to 13% degradation). As to the write performance, 28% to 45% improvement can be achieved depending on the behavior of the operations.

#!Summary: Sungear is a software system that supports a rapid, visually interactive and biologist-driven comparison of large datasets. The datasets can come from microarray experiments (e.g. genes induced in each experiment), from comparative genomics (e.g. genes present in each genome) or even from non-biological applications (e.g. demographics or baseball statistics). Sungear represents multiple datasets as vertices in a polygon. Each possible intersection among the sets is represented as a circle inside the polygon. The position of the circle is determined by the position of the vertices represented in the intersection and the area of the circle is determined by the number of elements in the intersection. Sungear shows which Gene Ontology terms are over-represented in a subset of circles or anchors. The intuitive Sungear interface has enabled biologists to determine quickly which dataset or groups of datasets play a role in a biological function of interest. Availability: A live online version of Sungear can be found at http://virtualplant-prod.bio.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/sungear/index.cgi Contact: shasha@cs.nyu.edu Supplementary information: Submitted---link TBD.

#!Recently, cars are equipped with a lot of sensors for safety driving. We have been trying to store the driving-scene video with such sensor data and to detect the change of scenery of streets. Detection results can be used for building historical database of town scenery, automatic landmark updating of maps, and so forth. In order to compare images to detect changes, image retrieval taken at nearly identical locations is required as the first step. Since Global Positioning System (GPS) data essentially contain some noises, we cannot rely only on GPS data for our image retrieval. Therefore, we have developed an image retrieval algorithm employing edge-histogram-based image features in conjunction with hierarchical search. By using edge histograms projected onto the vertical and horizontal axes, the retrieval has been made robust to image variation due to weather change, clouds, obstacles, and so on. In addition, matching cost has been made small by limiting the matching candidates employing the hierarchical search. Experimental results have demonstrated that the mean retrieval accuracy has been improved from 65% to 76% for the front-view images and from 34% to 53% for the side-view images.

#*Dynamic fractal unifying interaction confirmed with magnetospheric behavior and orbital data: Research Articles
#@Eugene Savov

#cComplexity
#index1395
#!The solar wind makes the magnetosphere to expand and contract as indicated by the expansions and contractions of the auroral oval due to balancing of the dynamic pressure of the ambient space plasma at inner and outer magnetic lines. This self-similar magnetospheric behavior elucidates the controversial magnetic storm-substorm relationship and reveals the 3D-spiral structure of magnetic interaction. The found self-similarly evolving structure of one seen as fundamental interaction suggests dynamic fractal unifying interaction that builds a firework universe having 3D-spiral code. The unifying interaction is described with equation drawn in new fundamental dynamic fractal framework. The equation of unifying interaction converges to the inverse square laws and the principle of uncertainty at laboratory scales. The dynamic fractal fundamental framework is made of one 3D-spirally-faster-inward contracting and expanding, oscillating, basic matter. It simply accounts for observed constant speed of light and for the creation of bright and dark bands on a screen behind a tiny slit. The dynamic fractal framework is quantitatively confirmed with the orbital data for the Milky Way Galaxy, the Sun, the Earth, and the triple asteroid system 87 Sylvia. Many testable predictions are also made. The presented new fundamental dynamic fractal framework allows qualitative and quantitative modeling and simplification. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!A class of implicit two-step integration methods is introduced having s stages which may be computed in parallel. Since all stage solutions are approximations with equal accuracy and stability properties these methods were attributed as 'peer' methods. Using a special result on Vandermonde matrices we identify one subclass of order s-1 which is zero stable for general stepsize sequences. A further analysis for singularly perturbed problems shows that no order reduction occurs and the accuracy is essentially determined by the regularity of the smooth component. These results are backed by several numerical examples even including one differential algebraic problem.

#!For a simplicial complex X and a field K, let h˜i(X) = dim H˜i (X; K).It is shown that if X, Y are complexes on the same vertex set, then for k ≥ 0 h˜k-1(X ∩ Y) ≤ Σσ ∈ Y Σi+j=k h˜i-1 (X[σ])ċ h˜j-1 (lk(Y, σ)).A simplicial complex X is d-Leray over K, if H˜i(Y; K) = 0 for all induced subcomplexes Y ⊂ X and i ≥ d. Let LK(X) denote the minimal d such that X is d-Leray over K. The above theorem implies that if X, Y are simplicial complexes on the same vertex set then LK(X ∩ Y) ≤ LK(X) + LK(Y).Reformulating this inequality in commutative algebra terms, we obtain the following result conjectured by Terai: If I, J are square-free monomial ideals in S = K[x1, ..., xn], then reg(I + J) ≤ reg(I) + reg(J) - 1, where reg (I) denotes the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of I.

#!The complexity of animating trees, shrubs and foliage is an impediment to the efficient and realistic depiction of natural environments. This paper presents an algorithm to extract, from a single video sequence, motion fields of real shrubs under the influence of wind, and to transfer this motion to the animation of complex, synthetic 3D plant models. The extracted motion is retargeted without requiring physical simulation. First, feature tracking is applied to the video footage, allowing the 2D position and velocity of automatically identified features to be clustered. A key contribution of the method is that the hierarchy obtained through statistical clustering can be used to synthesize a 2D hierarchical geometric structure of branches that terminates according to the cut-off threshold of a classification algorithm. This step extracts both the shape and the motion of a hierarchy of features groups that are identified as geometrical branches. The 2D hierarchy is then extended to three dimensions using the estimated spatial distribution of the features within each group. Another key contribution is that this 3D hierarchical structure can be efficiently used as a motion controller to animate any complex 3D model of similar but non-identical plants using a standard skinning algorithm. Thus, a single video source of a moving shrub becomes an input device for a large class of virtual shrubs. We illustrate the results on two examples of shrubs and one outdoor tree. Extensions to other outdoor plants are discussed.

#!Within the European &lsquo;Vehicle Model Based Diagnosis&rsquo; (VMBD) project, demonstrator vehicles with built&dash;in faults provided a serious challenge to model&dash;based diagnosis techniques and a real&dash;life test&dash;bed for their evaluation. One of the guiding applications within VMBD was model&dash;based on&dash;board diagnosis of faults in a turbo diesel engine system with a focus on potential origins of increased carbon emissions. This paper focuses on the application aspects. We discuss the requirements imposed, the way they were addressed by the chosen solutions, and the results obtained by the on&dash;board diagnosis prototype running on the demonstrator vehicle. The most important challenges of the demonstrator were to apply model&dash;based diagnosis systems to dynamic systems with feedback, to handle systems without a rigorous mathematical model (such as a combustion engine), and to try to provide the response times required for real&dash;time applications.

#!We propose a robust algorithm for estimating the projective reconstruction from image features using the RANSAC-based Triangulation method. In this method, we select input points randomly, separate the input points into inliers and outliers by computing their reprojection error, and correct the outliers so that they can become inliers. The reprojection error and correcting outliers are computed using the Triangulation method. After correcting the outliers, we can reliably recover projective motion and structure using the projective factorization method. Experimental results showed that errors can be reduced significantly compared to the previous research as a result of robustly estimated projective reconstruction.

#!Ontological analysis has been shown to be an effective first step in the construction of robust knowledge based systems. However, the modeling and simulation community has not taken advantage of the benefits of ontology management methods and tools. Moreover, the popularity of semantic technologies and the semantic web has provided several beneficial opportunities for the modeling and simulation communities of interest. This paper describes the role of ontologies in facilitating simulation modeling. It outlines the technical challenges in distributed simulation modeling and describes how ontology-based methods may be applied to address these challenges. The paper concludes by describing an ontology-based solution framework for simulation modeling and analysis and outlining the benefits of this solution approach.

#!If you are a network administrator, you're under a lot of pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are completely safe from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders. Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is an essential--but often overwhelming--challenge. Snort, the defacto open source standard of intrusion detection tools, is capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP network.

#!Every company large and small wants to boost its sales, control its spending, and keep the auditors at the Internal Revenue Service happy. But, no company wants to waste time on more paperwork. These days, a growing number of companies are turning to QuickBooks accounting software not only to speed up their bookkeeping efforts, but manage their businesses more effectively. Organizations come in all shapes, sizes, and business models, so it's no surprise that accounting practices can be a convoluted road to travel. QuickBooks can handle many of the financial tasks companies face, but the price you pay is an overabundance of software features. To make the learning curve even more challenging, QuickBooks doesn't come with a manual. Fortunately, to help pave the road to accounting success, there's QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual, a comprehensive guide from O'Reilly that examines everything the QuickBooks Pro edition has to offer, from invoices and inventory to assets and accounts payable. With QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual, financial managers can quickly learn how to use the program's tools to implement and maintain critical accounting processes. By covering details in a friendly and light-hearted way, the book explains when and why a feature is useful, and then offers indispensable, relevant advice. Each page of this Missing Manual provides insightful tips and tricks to help readers become more efficient, sophisticated users no matter what the extent of their existing knowledge is. Whether you're interested in QuickBooks for its basic bookkeeping features or its more powerful, business planning tools, the only way to truly harness its power is to read the book that should have been in the box: QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual.

#!Praise for the First Edition “Trust me on this one...if you're an Active Directory engineer or architect, this is the book you need. It's the companion that's going to help you keep your job if you're up in the middle of the night trying to understand how something works or why it's not working. It's truly an amazing book.” -Scott Rachui, MCSE and Senior Active Directory Engineer, author of MCSE Exchange Server 5.5 for Dummies “This is the best book on Windows 2000 that I have read and one of the best computer books I have ever read. The most unique quality is the excellent explanation of how to use scripting to maximize your results and minimize your effort. This book is especially well suited to the enterprise audience that has to deploy many servers (100+) and not just 1-10. If you have even a small bit of programming experience, you will really appreciate the in-depth explanations of Windows 2000 under the covers.” -Eric Chipko “Wow!! I love this book. I'd trade all my books covering Active Directory for this book in a second. The material is covered at a depth that I haven't seen in any other book-and I've looked at most of them. The material is presented in a straightforward manner that doesn't put you to sleep. An NT4 administrator could easily read this book and become an expert at Active Directory. I especially appreciated the chapter on Active Directory security.” -Brian Arkills, author of LDAP Directories ExplainedPraise for the Second Edition “If you are committed and really desire to know what makes Active Directory tick-and with it the backbone of the latest, and greatest, generation of Windows Network Operating Systems-then there is no better guide to get you there than this book. Inside Active Directory has no equal in the breadth, depth, and scope of its value to a technical practitioner.” -Rick Kingslan, Microsoft MVP, Directory Services “Kouti and Seitsonen provide excellent coverage of topics a lot of people have difficulty understanding and setting up properly. This book supplies you with sound background theory so you can understand these concepts and at the same time gives just the right amount of detail to actually accomplish what you are trying to do.” -Harold McFarland, Editor, Readers Preference Reviews “The style of this book is very appealing. It gives sufficient detail for the experienced administrator and explains what is happening 'behind the scenes' at each step, which is extremely helpful when problems arise. An excellent read and an essential component for any skilled administrator!” -Jeff Dunkelberger, Solutions Architect “An outstanding refresh of an already great book, Inside Active Directory, Second Edition, should be in the toolbox of any serious Active Directory administrator, architect, or developer. Inside Active Directory is one of the five books I refer to on a weekly basis. Thanks to the authors for all their hard work and dedication.” -Joe Richards, Microsoft MVP, Windows Server/Active DirectoryThe most practical, comprehensive, and highly praised guide to Active Directory has now been fully updated for Windows Server 2003.

#@Kyparisia A. Papanikolaou,Andrew Mabbott,Susan Bull,Maria Grigoriadou
#t2006
#cInteracting with Computers
#index1538
#!Recently, research in individual differences and in particular, learning and cognitive style, has been used as a basis to consider learner preferences in a web-based educational context. Modelling style in a web-based learning environment demands that developers build a specific framework describing how to design a variety of options for learners with different approaches to learning. In this paper two representative examples of educational systems, Flexi-OLM and INSPIRE, that provide learners a variety of options designed according to specific style categorisations, are presented. Experimental results from two empirical studies performed on the systems to investigate learners' learning and cognitive style, and preferences during interaction, are described. It was found that learners do have a preference regarding their interaction, but no obvious link between style and approaches offered, was detected. Derived from an examination of this experimental data, we suggest that while style information can be used to inform the design of learning environments that accommodate learners' individual differences, it would be wise to recommend interactions based on learners' behaviour. Learning environments should allow learners or learners' interaction behaviour to select or trigger the appropriate approach for the particular learner in the specific context. Alternative approaches towards these directions are also discussed.

#cProceedings of the 21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops - Volume 01
#index1554
#!Although many defense techniques against scanning worms have been developed, they have difficulty in ingress filtering if the incoming scanning traffic has insufficient intensity, which is usually the case. To make matters worse, legitimate Internet services behaving like worms and dynamic network environments undermines the efficacy of the techniques. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient defense algorithm against Internet scanning worms that has high detection rate and low false positive rate. Our defense algorithm observes the protocol behavior of TCP SYN retries and applies a relative entropy scheme, which is used for measuring the distance between two distributions, to process the collected information. It builds up the black-list to isolate detected hosts from the Internet, and adjusts related parameters adaptively according to the observed traffic. Moreover, it acquires the simplicity and effectiveness at the ingress point only by inspecting SYN retry on a unidirectional link, which makes the defense mechanism easily applicable to a network. Against real-life traces, we investigate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with that of SNORT. The results manifest clearly that our algorithm outperforms the rate-based detection technique in terms of detection rate, detection speed and false positive rate.

#!Packet loss models play an essential role in computer networks analysis. Performance evaluation studies often abstract the loss and delay characteristics of a path or network with a single end-to-end analytical model. This model should be able to represent the characteristics of the path and accurately reproduce the impact of delay and losses on the studied protocol while keeping complexity low.

#!This paper presents a Business-Oriented Model of Factors that affect the adoption of wireless High Speed Data Services (HSDS). We reviewed business IT acceptance literature and developed an explorative survey of a sample of twelve companies in Europe and USA. From this, a theoretical model was created and hypotheses were formulated. Data were then collected on a sample of 1545 companies in USA and Europe. Based on these results, we developed a model that combined the key ideas of both TAM and TTF and showed that both were necessary in predicting wireless High Speed Data Service adoption.

#!“This book clearly shows how today's industry pressures and business challenges mandate renewal of the contract between organizations and their IT assets and peopleï¾and it illustrates how a service-oriented approach to IT can help organizations go through the necessary transformation. The role of governance in bringing IT and business closer together is particularly well explained, and the book is worth reading for that alone.” ï¾Neil Ward-Dutton, Research Director, Macehiter Ward-Dutton “It's easy to pay lip service to the concept of business/IT alignment, but in The New Language of Business, Sandy Carter walks the walk. Few treatments of SOA ground this admittedly difficult topic in the world of business as thoroughly as Sandy has here. I'd recommend this book to any business reader who wants to leverage IT to make their business more agile and innovative, and to any technical reader who wishes to understand how to place SOA in the business context where it belongs.” ï¾Jason Bloomberg, Senior Analyst and Principal, ZapThink LLC “A very valuable read. In today's globally connected marketplace profitable growth requires business flexibility and continuous innovation, both of which are increasingly proving to be impossible without business modularity and the new table-stakes technology SOA.” ï¾Ron Williams, Professor, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill “Sandy has provided a pragmatic and holistic perspective on Service Oriented Architectures. She adds credibility by sharing IBM's in-depth customer research as well as case studies to support the findings. The book is a strong source book for those wanting to get started with SOA.” ï¾Judith Hurwitz, President & CEO, Hurwitz & Associates, coauthor, Service Oriented Architectures for Dummies “Few people have thought as long or as hard about SOA as Sandy Carter. This book embodies her invaluable work and the work of many at IBM to research, define, deploy and make SOA happen. Useful not just from a SOA perspective, but also as a concise articulation of the contemporary concepts fundamental to understanding where business and IT are heading.” ï¾Carol Baroudi, coauthor Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, Senior Analyst, Aberdeen Group “The New Language of Business: SOA & Web 2.0 is based on the collective feedback from industry leaders at organizations of all sizes, in more than 50 countries, who shared their views, experiences, and challenges of aligning technology with business goals.” ï¾From the foreword by Steve Mills, Senior Vice President and Group Executive,ï¾ IBM Software Group There is now a direct, provable link between an organization's flexibility and business performance. To optimize flexibility, companies must achieve unprecedented levels of integration and automation of key processes and infrastructure, both internally and externally. At the same time, they must learn to manage their processes far more dynamically and responsively. They must become flex-pon-sive*. Until recently, technology stood in the way of achieving these goals. Thanks to the emergence of service oriented architecture (SOA), Web 2.0, and open standards, technology now enables companies to achieve those goals. In The New Language of Business, one of IBM's top SOA strategist demonstrates how business leaders can use innovations in technology to drive dramatic process improvements and support accelerating change. Sandy Carter shows how to deconstruct your business into a “componentized” business model, then support that model with linked, repeatable IT services that can adapt quickly, easily, and economically. These techniques will help both IT professionals and business leaders reach new levels of operational excellence to deliver the market-focused innovations that matter most.

Writing for executives and business leaders inside and outside IT, Carter explains why flexibility and responsiveness are now even more crucial to successï¾and why services-based strategies offer the greatest promise for achieving them. You'll learn how to organize your business into reusable process componentsï¾and support them with cost-effective IT services that adapt quickly and easily to change.

#!Runtime Patterns with Caching Proxy and Tivoli Access Manager User authentication and authorization Runtime node placement guidelines Security is such a fundamental enabler of e-busines that in the emerging business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets, effective security can make the difference betwen being successful and becoming an “also ran”. The promise of e-business and its ability to create new revenue streams is predicated on the ability of these new business processes to reach these new markets and customers. That promise can evaporate if security issues are not addressed up front. This IBM Redbook addresses the security issues of user authentication and authorization using the concept of Patterns. Patterns for e-business are a group of proven, reusable assets that can help speed the process of developing applications. In this redbook, we describe guidelines and options for the selection of Runtime patterns that include user authentication and authorization considerations in the design process. Specifically, we address software and node configuration scenarios within the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and give examples of implementation procedures.

#!Message-based communication offers the potential benefits of providing stronger specification and cleaner separation between components. Compared with shared-memory interactions, message passing has the potential disadvantages of more expensive data exchange (no direct sharing) and more complicated programming.In this paper we report on the language, verification, and run-time system features that make messages practical as the sole means of communication between processes in the Singularity operating system. We show that using advanced programming language and verification techniques, it is possible to provide and enforce strong system-wide invariants that enable efficient communication and low-overhead software-based process isolation. Furthermore, specifications on communication channels help in detecting programmer mistakes early---namely at compile-time---thereby reducing the difficulty of the message-based programming model.The paper describes our communication invariants, the language and verification features that support them, as well as implementation details of the infrastructure. A number of benchmarks show the competitiveness of this approach.

#!Desktop operating systems such as Windows and Linux base scheduling decisions on CPU consumption; processes that consume fewer CPU cycles are prioritized, assuming that interactive processes gain from this since they spend most of their time waiting for user input. However, this doesn't work for modern multimedia applications which require significant CPU resources. We therefore suggest a new metric to identify interactive processes by explicitly measuring interactions with the user, and we use it to design and implement a process scheduler. Measurements using a variety of applications indicate that this scheduler is very effective in distinguishing between competing interactive and noninteractive processes.

#!We consider involutory antimorphisms ϕ of a free monoid A* and their fixed points, called ϕ-palindromes or pseudopalindromes. A ϕ-palindrome reduces to a usual palindrome when ϕ is the reversal operator. For any word w ∈ A* the right (resp. left) ϕ-palindrome closure of w is the shortest ϕ-palindrome having w as a prefix (resp. suffix). We prove some results relating ϕ-palindrome closure operators with periodicity and conjugacy, and derive some interesting closure properties for the languages of finite Sturmian and episturmian words. In particular, a finite word w is Sturmian if and only if both its palindromic closures are so. Moreover, in such a case, both the palindromic closures of w share the same minimal period of w. A new characterization of finite Sturmian words follows, in terms of periodicity and special factors of their palindromic closures. Some weaker results can be extended to the episturmian case. By using the right ϕ-palindrome closure, we extend the construction of standard episturmian words via directive words. In this way one obtains a family of infinite words, called ϕ-standard words, which are morphic images of episturmian words, as well as a wider family of infinite words including the Thue-Morse word on two symbols.

#*A parametric associative memory emulation
#@S. H. Dalrymple
#t1975
#cACM SIGMICRO Newsletter
#index1606
#!An experimental associative memory facility has been created by microprogramming a conventional computer. The microprogramming was done by expansion of an IBM 1130 emulation that was microcoded on a Digital Scientific Corporation META 4 computer. The associative memory (AM), as seen by the 1130 applications programmer, is an integral part of the computer with 54 machine instructions provided for its control and use.The structural characteristics of the apparent associative memory are parametrically defined to the emulation via a special SETUP command. This command may occur repeatedly within a program to dynamically alter the AM's characteristics or, indeed, to provide several different AM's. The characteristics that may be specified include the cell width (W) in 16-bit word increments, the number of cells (N), the locations in core memory to be used by the AM and its associated registers, and the memory protect status of these memory locations. The parameters are maintained in a fast scratch-pad memory, whence they are employed to control the AM emulation.Three pseudoregisters are used by the associative memory: (1) a data register (DR), which can hold the contents of one cell (i. e., W bits in length); (2) a response register (RR) N bits in length; and (3) an availability register (AR), also N bits in length.The data register provides the primary interface between the AM and the 1130 program. The response register is employed to indicate which cells in the AM have responded to a given search command. The availability register is used to indicate which cells are empty (or available) and which are to be considered whenever a search command is executed. The AM can be addressed either conventionally or associatively.The commands provided to utilize the AM fall into five categories: (1) register commands to manipulate the DR, RR, and AR; (2) fetch and store commands to store and retrieve information; (3) search commands to compare a given argument against the AM; (4) field-to-field search commands that compare two fields within each cell; and (5) test and branch instructions. Field specifications for search commands are defined through the use of pointer and length information contained within the command.Communication with the AM is via the DR. Search arguments and data to be stored are placed there, as are data retrieved from the AM. Searches permitted include match, no match, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, next lower, next greater, minimum, and maximum.The commands themselves, viewed as 1130 operators, may occupy either one, two, or three machine words, depending upon the operation, and may contain an address, one or two pointer specifications, one or two length specifications, a reset flag, or an immediate value, as required. Indexing is permitted for those operations having an address. The code-cracking mechanism of the 1130 emulation is used but is augmented to handle the three-word instructions. Microsubprograms are then executed for each emulated instruction or class of instructions.The META 4 computer on which the AM system was implemented is a flexible, logical processor that is controlled by an easily modified, random-access, read-only memory (ROM). Up to 32 general-purpose registers may be employed, together with three data buses (two source and one destination), an arithmetic-logical unit, and a shifter unit. Control is exercised at the gate level via microcode commands, 32 bits in length, in the ROM. Core memory is treated essentially as a peripheral with access via a pair of registers, one for data and the other for address information. The usual complement of peripherals, card readers, printers, disks, etc., may be attached.The basic hardware configuration required for 1130 emulation on a META 4 consists of 8K main-core memory, 2K read-only memory, and 20 registers. This configuration was augmented for the AM emulation by the addition of 8K more core, 2K additional ROM, two additional registers, two scratch-pad memories of 64 words each, and a set of internal timers to provide timing information on application programs.Several applications have been programmed in both a conventional manner and by using the associative memory capability in order to obtain relative timing information. One such application, a personnel file information storage and retrieval system, has provided a speed advantage of as much as 10 to 1 when the AM is employed. Building on the AM capability, a set of macroinstructions was developed to provide an apparent associative processor. Several matrix manipulation routines were developed using this facility, and these routines also exhibited a significant speed advantage over their conventionally programmed counterparts.

#!Setting up your DDF environment Analyzing DDF performance Advanced topics: Thread pooling, sysplex support, and HiperSockets When DB2's Distributed Data Facility (DDF) was announced in the late eighties, it was looked at by many people as a nice gadget, but not something anybody would use in a real OLTP production environment. Distributed database access and DB2's DDF have come a long way since. DDF is now a full-function transaction monitor, using a highly efficient database interoperability protocol (DRDA) equipped with thread pooling and connection management that allows it to support very large networks. In this IBM Redbook we describe how to set up your DDF environment, and how to deploy the DDF capabilities in different configurations, including how to develop applications that access distributed databases. We also describe a set of more advanced features, such as thread pooling, and high availability distributed configurations, in a DB2 data sharing environment. We also demonstrate the advantages of using HiperSockets with DB2 for z/OS and OS/390 and DB2 Connect for zLinux. As performance and problem analysis are very important in today's production environments with applications demanding subsecond response times and zero down time, the publication also discusses the traces available to you to do performance monitoring and problem determination. We hope that after reading this publication you will have a better view of a wide range of functions that DDF has to offer, and say "Wow, I had no idea that I could do all of this with DDF!"

#!Several strategies to retrieve depth information from a sequence of images have been described so far. In this paper a method that turns around the existing symbiosis between stereovision and motion is introduced; motion minimizes correspondence ambiguities, and stereovision enhances motion information. The central idea behind our approach is to transpose the spatially defined problem of disparity estimation into the spatial-temporal domain. Motion is analyzed in the original sequences by means of the so-called permanency effect and the disparities are calculated from the resulting two-dimensional motion charge maps. This is an important contribution to the traditional stereovision depth analysis, where disparity is got from the image luminescence. In our approach, disparity is studied from a motion-based persistency charge measure.

#!This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm (a-hGA) with adaptive local search scheme. For designing the a-hGA, a local search technique is incorporated in the loop of genetic algorithm (GA), and whether or not the local search technique is used in the GA is automatically determined by the adaptive local search scheme. Two modes of adaptive local search schemes are developed in this paper. First mode is to use the conditional local search method that can measure the average fitness values obtained from the continuous two generations of the a-hGA, while second one is to apply the similarity coefficient method that can measure a similarity among the individuals of the population of the a-hGA. These two adaptive local search schemes are included in the a-hGA loop, respectively. Therefore, the a-hGA can be divided into two types: a- hGA1 and a-hGA2. To prove the efficiency of the a-hGA1 and a-hGA2, a canonical GA (cGA) and a hybrid GA (hGA) with local search technique and without any adaptive local search scheme are also presented. In numerical example, all the algorithms (cGA, hGA, a-hGA1 and a-hGA2) are tested and analyzed. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed a-hGA1 and a-hGA2 is proved by various measures of performance.

#!Two identical customers with deterministically identical service times arrive at a queueing system simultaneously (Twins), but leave the system 2 hours apart. Is their sojourn time predictable? Is the system fair? We propose a novel measure based on the principle that in a predictable and fair system, "twin" customers should not depart the system very far apart. We analyze this measure for a number of common service policies and compare the results. We compare the results to those of other fairness and predictability approaches proposed recently and discuss its usefulness.

#!This paper presents a novel VR (Virtual Reality) trained BDI (belief, desire, intention) software agent used to construct crowd simulations for emergency response. The BDI framework allows modeling of human behavior with a high degree of fidelity. The proposed simulation has been developed using AnyLogic software to mimic crowd evacuation from an area under a terrorist bomb attack. The attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are studied by conducting human in the loop experiments in VR using the CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the effect of various parameters on key performance indicators such as crowd evacuation rate and densities.

#!The effects of metaphors on learning have been proved by many studies. Learners naturally invoke metaphors when learning new concepts because metaphors stimulate them to generate models of the domain to be learned. However, little evidence has been seen of metaphors' effect on developing learners' mental models. Since metaphors function by providing familiar concepts that help learners to construct new knowledge, metaphors' effects may be more apparent to novice learners. This study explores the effects of metaphors on both novice and expert learners' performance and their mental-model development as documented by three different measurement methods. It also examines the relationship between subjects' performance and their mental models. The results indicate that metaphors may facilitate novices' construction of integrative knowledge but not simple knowledge. In addition, metaphors may possibly have lasting effects on expert learning but the effects may not be seen immediately after learning.

#!We present a method for progressive deforming meshes. Most existing mesh decimation methods focus on static meshes. However, there are more and more animation data today, and it is important to address the problem of simplifying deforming meshes. Our method is based on deformation oriented decimation (DOD) error metric and dynamic connectivity updating (DCU) algorithm. Deformation oriented decimation extends the deformation sensitivity decimation (DSD) error metric by augmenting an additional term to model the distortion introduced by deformation. This new metric preserves not only geometric features but also areas with large deformation. Using this metric, a static reference connectivity is extracted for the whole animation. Dynamic connectivity updating algorithm utilizes vertex trees to further reduce geometric distortion by allowing the connectivity to change. Temporal coherence in the dynamic connectivity between frames is achieved by penalizing large deviations from the reference connectivity. The combination of DOD and DCU demonstrates better simplification and triangulation performance than previous methods for deforming mesh simplification.

#index1645
#!Motivation: We introduce a novel approach to multiple alignment that is based on an algorithm for rapidly checking whether single matches are consistent with a partial multiple alignment. This leads to a sequence annealing algorithm, which is an incremental method for building multiple sequence alignments one match at a time. Our approach improves significantly on the standard progressive alignment approach to multiple alignment. Results: The sequence annealing algorithm performs well on benchmark test sets of protein sequences. It is not only sensitive, but also specific, drastically reducing the number of incorrectly aligned residues in comparison to other programs. The method allows for adjustment of the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff and can be used to reliably identify homologous regions among protein sequences. Availability: An implementation of the sequence annealing algorithm is available at http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/amap/ Contact: sariel@cs.berkeley.edu

#!Scheduling a program (i.e. constructing a timetable for the execution of its operations) is one of the most powerful methods for automatic parallelization. A schedule gives a blueprint for constructing a synchronous program, suitable for an ASIC or VLIW processor. However, constructing a schedule entails solving a large linear program. Even if one accepts the (experimental) fact that the Simplex is almost always polynomial, the scheduling time is of the order of a large power of the program size. Hence, the method does not scale well. The present paper proposes two methods for improving the situation. First, a large program can be divided into smaller units (processes), which can be scheduled separately. This is structured scheduling. Second, one can use projection methods for solving linear programs incrementally. This is specially efficient if the dependence graph is sparse.

#!e is a programming language designed for modeling and verification of electronic systems. As such it is used extensively in the microchip industry, and was recently declared an IEEE standard, e is also a powerful general-purpose language used in the implementation of complex commercial software tools.It was suggested some time ago that a number of idioms in e resemble those of AOP, but the suggestion was never examined in depth. The present paper takes up this task. For this purpose the relevant mechanisms in e are compared with those of today's prominent aspect-oriented language - AspectJ - with respect to syntax, semantics, and application.e's aspect-oriented capabilities turn out to be a small subset of AspectJ's, but an interesting one. It is weaker in its support for implementing developmental and non-functional concerns. However, with its simpler syntax and economical semantics, e captures in a natural way crosscutting concerns that stem from the application domain. Thus, e seems to exemplify an original variant of AOP - one that is conservative and robust from a software design point of view.

#!E-Commerce technologies are interactive in nature, yet most research on E-Commerce adoption and use fails to consider this feature and the technology's social context of use in its theorizing. In this paper, we seek to theorize the technological feature of interactivity in a social context of information asymmetry by studying the use of E-Commerce technology among car sales associates in the US. Drawing on Social Exchange Theory (Kelley, 1979), we develop a model of interactive technology use that incorporates the user's beliefs about his/her exchange partner, the user's attitude toward technology use and the technology's perceived usefulness for the work process it is impacting. After refining our model with insights gained from observations of and interviews with a few car sales associates, we then test our contextualized model of E-Commerce use with data collected from a national survey of car sales associates (n=137).Our results show that attitude and users' beliefs about their exchange partners improve our ability to predict IT use. Furthermore, the contexualization of TAM highlights the theory's assumptions about the unemotional and individually-focused nature of users' decision making with respect to IT use.

#!Graph bandwidth minimization (GBM) is a classical and challenging problem in graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization. Most of existing researches on this problem have focused on unweighted graphs. In this paper, we study the bandwidth minimization problem of weighted caterpillars, and propose several algorithms for solving various types of caterpillars and general graphs. More specifically, we show that the GBM problem on caterpillars with hair-length at most 2 and the GBM problem on star-shape caterpillars are NP-complete, and give a lower bound of the graph bandwidth for general weighted graphs. For caterpillars with hair-length at most 1, we present an O(n log n log(nwmax))-time algorithm to compute an optimal bandwidth layout, where n is the total number of vertices in the graph and wmax is the maximum wedge weight. For caterpillars with hair-length at most k, we give a k-approximation algorithm. For arbitrary caterpillars and general graphs, we give a heuristic algorithm and some experimental results. Experiments show that the solutions obtained by our heuristic algorithm are roughly within a factor of clog(n) of the lower bound for a small number c, which is consistent with the inapproximability results of this problem (i.e., no constant approximation for the GBM problem unless P = NP).

#!A framework is provided for evaluation of packet delay distribution in an optical circuit-switched network. The framework is based on a fluid traffic model, packet queueing at edge routers, and circuit-switched transmission between edge routers. Packets are assigned to buffers according to their destination, delay constraint, physical route and wavelength. At every decision epoch, a subset of buffers is allocated to end-to-end circuits for transmission, where circuit holding times are based on limited and exhaustive circuit allocation policies. To ensure computational tractability, the framework approximates the evolution of each buffer independently. "Slack variables" are introduced to decouple amongst buffers in a way that the evolution of each buffer remains consistent with all other buffers in the network. The delay distribution is derived for a single buffer and an approximation is given for a network of buffers. The approximation entails finding a fixed point for the functional relation between the "slack variables" and a specific circuit allocation policy. An analysis of a specific policy, in which circuits are probabilistically allocated based on buffer size, is given as an illustrative example. The framework is shown to be in good agreement with a discrete event simulation model.

#!One of the typical causes of errors in team cooperative activities, such as in central control rooms of power plants and cockpits in aircrafts, is conflicts among team members' intentions. If mutual awareness and communication were perfectly established and maintained, conflicts could be detected and recovered by team members; however, this does not happen in practice. In this paper, we provide a framework for detecting conflicts among team members' intentions based on team intention inference, aiming to make machines function as a coordinator for cooperative activities. In previous work, we developed a method for team intention inference based on a definition of 'we-intention'. We-intention is other-regarding intentions relating to situations in which some agents act together, and is represented as a set of individual intentions and mutual beliefs. In this framework, a conflict can be defined as a set of individual intentions and false beliefs (undesired procedures), and detected by searching for such combinations. We applied the proposed method to the operation of a plant simulator operated by a two-person team, and it was confirmed through an experiment that this method could list candidates for conflicts by type and set the actual conflict high in priority in the tested context.

#*Evolving dynamic Bayesian networks with Multi-objective genetic algorithms

#!A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a probabilistic network that models interdependent entities that change over time. Given example sequences of multivariate data, we use a genetic algorithm to synthesize a network structure that models the causal relationships that explain the sequence. We use a multi-objective evaluation strategy with a genetic algorithm. The multi-objective criteria are a network's probabilistic score and structural complexity score. Our use of Pareto ranking is ideal for this application, because it naturally balances the effect of the likelihood and structural simplicity terms used in the BIC network evaluation heuristic. We use a basic structural scoring formula, which tries to keep the number of links in the network approximately equivalent to the number of variables. We also use a simple representation that favors sparsely connected networks similar in structure to those modeling biological phenomenon. Our experiments show promising results when evolving networks ranging from 10 to 30 variables, using a maximal connectivity of between 3 and 4 parents per node. The results from the multi-objective GA were superior to those obtained with a single objective GA.

#!We present a hyper-interaction platform which integrates several newly developed techniques, including motion classification, a motion reaction control mechanism and a high precision 3-D model of the International Space Station. The goal is to build an interaction platform for trainers to navigate in a virtual reality. The platform can be applied to customized mission training. The system integrated visualization environment, underlying 3-D model, and a human body tracking mechanism. The tracking system will be extended to 3-D coordination reconstruction and thus behaviors of users can be precisely identified. These navigation parameters are used in controlling navigation in the 3-D virtual environment. Another important issue of this system is to define a model for motion reaction. The definition of reaction can be applied to avatars or to the virtual environment. These integrated technologies can also be used in other virtual reality environments.

#!We present a method for scattered data approximation with subdivision surfaces which actually uses the true representation of the limit surface as a linear combination of smooth basis functions associated with the control vertices. This is unlike previous techniques which used only piecewise linear approximations of the limit surface. By this we can assign arbitrary parameterizations to the given sample points, including those generated by parameter correction. We present a robust and fast algorithm for exact closest point search on Loop surfaces by combining Newton iteration and non-linear minimization. Based on this we perform unconditionally convergent parameter correction to optimize the approximation with respect to the L2 metric and thus we make a well-established scattered data fitting technique which has been available before only for B-spline surfaces, applicable to subdivision surfaces. Further we exploit the fact that the control mesh of a subdivision surface can have arbitrary connectivity to reduce the L&infin; error up to a certain user-defined tolerance by adaptively restructuring the control mesh. By employing iterative least squares solvers, we achieve acceptable running times even for large amounts of data and we obtain high quality approximations by surfaces with relatively low control mesh complexity compared to the number of sample points. Since we are using plain subdivision surfaces, there is no need for multiresolution detail coefficients and we do not have to deal with the additional overhead in data and computational complexity associated with them.

#!ID-SP-M4M scheme means ID-based series-parallel multisignature schemes for multi-messages. In this paper, we investigate series-parallel multisignature schemes for multi-messages and propose an ID-SP-M4M scheme based on pairings in which signers in the same subgroup sign the same message, and those in different subgroups sign different messages. Our new scheme is an improvement over the series-parallel multisignature schemes introduced by Doi et al. [6]--[8] and subsequent results such as the schemes proposed by Burmester et al. [4] and the original protocols proposed by Tada [20], [21], in which only one message is to be signed. Furthermore, our ID-SP-M4M scheme is secure against forgery signature attack from parallel insiders under the BDH assumption.

#index1743
#!Cramer's rule expresses the solution to a system of simultaneous linear equaations in terms of ratios of determinants. It is widely known as an example of an impractical method for large systems because of the time required to compute the determinants. For 2-by-2 systems this time difficulty disappears and, since the method does not involve a search for pivots, it may appear to have an advantage over Gaussian elimination. In fact, methods based upon 2-by-2 Cramer's rule have been proposed for use on parallel computers. In this note we wish to point out that Cramer's rule is unsatisfactory even for 2-by-2 systems because of roundoff error difficulties.

#*GPS/IMU data fusion using multisensor Kalman filtering: introduction of contextual aspects

#cInformation Fusion
#index1749
#!The aim of this article is to develop a GPS/IMU multisensor fusion algorithm, taking context into consideration. Contextual variables are introduced to define fuzzy validity domains of each sensor. The algorithm increases the reliability of the position information. A simulation of this algorithm is then made by fusing GPS and IMU data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Bad data delivered by GPS sensor are detected and rejected using contextual information thus increasing reliability. Moreover, because of a lack of credibility of GPS signal in some cases and because of the drift of the INS, GPS/INS association is not satisfactory at the moment. In order to avoid this problem, the authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the IMU. Moreover, the filter developed here gives the possibility to easily add other sensors in order to achieve performances required.

#!The authors present uncomplicated and well established equations that can be used in simulation or real-world applications to determine key crossing points and aircraft proximity when the trajectory and speed of aircraft pairs are known. These equations, in closed form, were developed for computing the minimum distance between two aircraft within the four-dimensional (4D) space-time domain. The 4D flight proximity information can be used in simulation to evaluate large numbers of scheduled routes over a limited airspace for controller workload assessment. Also, it can be used to detect potential separation violations and impacts of traffic flow management (TFM) strategies. An example of computing the distance between two flights in 4D is presented. Sample aircraft proximity landscape in 4D space-time simulation with MATLAB code is also provided.

#!This paper addresses computational prediction of protein structural classes. Although in recent years progress in this field was made, the main drawback of the published prediction methods is a limited scope of comparison procedures, which in same cases were also improperly performed. Two examples include using protein datasets of varying homology, which has significant impact on the prediction accuracy, and comparing methods in pairs using different datasets. Based on extensive experimental work, the main aim of this paper is to revisit and reevaluate state of the art in this field. To this end, this paper performs a first-of-its-kind comprehensive and multi-goal study, which includes investigation of eight prediction algorithms, three protein sequence representations, three datasets with different homologies and finally three test procedures. Quality of several previously unused prediction algorithms, newly proposed sequence representation, and a new-to-the-field testing procedure is evaluated. Several important conclusions and findings are made. First, the logistic regression classifier, which was not previously used, is shown to perform better than other prediction algorithms, and high quality of previously used support vector machines is confirmed. The results also show that the proposed new sequence representation improves accuracy of the high quality prediction algorithms, while it does not improve results of the lower quality classifiers. The study shows that commonly used jackknife test is computationally expensive, and therefore computationally less demanding 10-fold cross-validation procedure is proposed. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference between these two procedures. The experiments show that sequence homology has very significant impact on the prediction accuracy, i.e. using highly homologous datasets results in higher accuracies. Thus, results of several past studies that use homologous datasets should not be perceived as reliable. The best achieved prediction accuracy for low homology datasets is about 57% and confirms results reported by Wang and Yuan [How good is the prediction of protein structural class by the component-coupled method?. Proteins 2000;38:165-175]. For a highly homologous dataset instance based classification is shown to be better than the previously reported results. It achieved 97% prediction accuracy demonstrating that homology is a major factor that can result in the overestimated prediction accuracy.

#!In secure group communications, the time cost associated with key updates in the events of member join and departure is an important aspect of quality of service, especially in large groups with highly dynamic membership. To achieve better time efficiency, we propose a join-exit-tree (JET) key management framework. First, a special key tree topology with join and exit subtrees is introduced to handle key updates for dynamic membership. Then, optimization techniques are employed to determine the capacities of join and exit subtrees for achieving the best time efficiency, and algorithms are designed to dynamically update the join and exit trees. We show that, on average, the asymptotic time cost for each member join/departure event is reduced to O(log (log n)) from the previous cost of O(log n), where n is the group size. Our experimental results based on simulated user activities as well as the real MBone data demonstrate that the proposed JET scheme can significantly improve the time efficiency, while maintaining low communication and computation cost, of tree-based contributory key management.

#*Perl Best Practices
#@Damian Conway
#t2005
#c
#index1765
#!Many programmers code by instinct, relying on convenient habits or a "style" they picked up early on. They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good. But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. Perl Best Practices author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects.With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging.They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, Perl Best Practices offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on how software ought to be created.Most of all, Perl Best Practices offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way.Praise for Perl Best Practices from Perl community members:"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of Perl Best Practices on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide." -- Randal Schwartz"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book." -- Peter Scott"Perl Best Practices will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of "scripting languages". Many of us have known Perl is a real programming language, worthy of all the tasks normally delegated to Java and C++. With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too." -- Andy Lester"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years." -- Bill Odom"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams." -- Andrew Sundstrom "Perl Best Practices provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers." -- Bennett Todd "I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer." -- Paul Fenwick "At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors. I recommend this book to anyone who prefers getting on with the job rather than going back and fixing errors caused by syntax and poor style issues." -- Jacinta Richardson "If you care about programming in any language read this book. Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it." -- Steven Lembark "The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book. There has never been a comprehensive reference on high quality Perl coding and style until Perl Best Practices. This book fills a large gap in every Perl bookshelf." -- Uri Guttman

#!Legendre orthogonal moments have been widely used in the field of image analysis. Because their computation by a direct method is very time expensive, recent efforts have been devoted to the reduction of computational complexity. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms are mainly focused on binary images. We propose here a new fast method for computing the Legendre moments, which is not only suitable for binary images but also for grey level images. We first establish a recurrence formula of one-dimensional (1D) Legendre moments by using the recursive property of Legendre polynomials. As a result, the 1D Legendre moments of order p, L"p=L"p(0), can be expressed as a linear combination of L"p"-"1(1) and L"p"-"2(0). Based on this relationship, the 1D Legendre moments L"p(0) can thus be obtained from the arrays of L"1(a) and L"0(a), where a is an integer number less than p. To further decrease the computation complexity, an algorithm, in which no multiplication is required, is used to compute these quantities. The method is then extended to the calculation of the two-dimensional Legendre moments L"p"q. We show that the proposed method is more efficient than the direct method.

#!A data stream is a potentially uninterrupted flow of data. Mining this flow makes it necessary to cope with uncertainty, as only a part of the stream can be stored. In this paper, we evaluate a statistical technique which biases the estimation of the support of patterns, so as to maximize either the precision or the recall, as chosen by the user, and limit the degradation of the other criterion. Theoretical results show that the technique is not far from the optimum, from the statistical standpoint. Experiments performed tend to demonstrate its potential, as it remains robust even under significant distribution drifts.

#*On the expressive power of semi-normal defaults in some semantic variants of default logic

#!Normality, semi-normality and prerequisite-freedom are examples of syntactic restrictions proposed for defaults. The expressive powers of Reiter's default logic under the corresponding syntactic restrictions have been analyzed by Janhunen. It is quite natural that to ask if such restrictions affect the expressive power of variants of default logic. In this paper we analyze the expressive powers of semi-normal (SN) variants of Lukaszewicz's default logic (LDL). Among another variants of default logic are cumulative default logic (CDL) by Brewka as well as commitment to assumptions default logic and quasi-default logic (CADL and QDL) by Giordano and Martelli. The expressive powers of these three variants under the corresponding syntactic restrictions are also investigated. The framework is based on the notion of Janhunen's polynomial, faithful and modular (PFM) translation function that maps systematically theories of one nonmonotonic logic to theories of other such that the semantics of theories is preserved. The criteria for evaluating expressive powers of nonmonotonic logics are existence/nonexistence of PFM translations between such nonmonotonic logics. According to the measure provided by PFM translation we point out that semi-normality, in general (allowing defaults possessing no consistency conditions) may decrease expressive power of defaults in LDL and prove that semi-normality does not affect expressiveness of defaults in LDL *(where defaults have at least one consistency condition). For assertion default theories, expressive power may decrease in certain DL variants if syntactic resections (such as semi-normality) are introduced. The reason why such anomalies arise is that consistency conditions of applied defaults are recorded in the support of extensions. To deal with this problem we introduce a weaker notion of PFM translation function, called quasi-PFM translation function (QPFM). According to the measure provided by QPFM translations we analyze expressive powers of semi-normal defaults in CDL, CADL and QDL and establish that, in CDL and QDL, semi-normality does not affect expressiveness of defaults yet. For CADL, unfortunately, semi-normal defaults are less expressive than general defaults even if we adopt a weaker notion of faithfulness than one by Janhunen. Noticing that arbitrary consistency conditions (including empty consistency condition) are allowed for LDL, CADL and QDL, we also consider the possibility of reducing multiple consistency conditions to a single consistency condition.

#!Existing work on animation synthesis can be roughly split into two approaches, those that combine segments of motion-capture data, and those that perform inverse kinematics. In this paper, we present a method for performing animation synthesis of an articulated object (e.g. human body and a dog) from a minimal set of body joint positions, following the approach of inverse kinematics. We tackle this problem from a learning perspective. Firstly, we address the need for knowledge on the physical constraints of the articulated body, so as to avoid the generation of a physically impossible poses. A common solution is to heuristically specify the kinematic constraints for the skeleton model. In this paper however, the physical constraints of the articulated body are represented using a hierarchical cluster model learnt from a motion capture database. Additionally, we shall show that the learnt model automatically captures the correlation between different joints through simultaneous modelling of their angles. We then show how this model can be utilised to perform inverse kinematics in a simple and efficient manner. Crucially, we describe how IK is carried out from a minimal set of end-effector positions. Following this, we show how this "learnt inverse kinematics" framework can be used to perform animation syntheses on different types of articulated structures. To this end, the results presented include the retargeting of a flat surface walking animation to various uneven terrains to demonstrate the synthesis of a full human body motion from the positions of only the hands, feet and torso. Additionally, we show how the same method can be applied to the animation synthesis of a dog using only its feet and torso positions.

#!This discussion presents a new perspective of subspace independent component analysis (ICA). The notion of a function of cumulants (kurtosis) is generalized to vector kurtosis. This vector kurtosis is utilized in the subspace ICA algorithm to estimate subspace independent components. One of the main advantages of the presented approach is its computational simplicity. The experiments have shown promising results in estimating subspace independent components.

#!In cellular networks, an important practical issue is how to limit the handoff dropping probability efficiently. One possible approach is to perform dynamic bandwidth reservation based on mobility predictions. With the rapid advances in mobile positioning technology, and the widespread availability of digital road maps previously designed for navigational devices, we propose a predictive bandwidth reservation scheme built upon these timely opportunities. In contrast to the common practice of utilizing only incoming handoff predictions at each cell to compute the reservations, our scheme is more efficient as it innovatively utilizes both incoming and outgoing handoff predictions; it can meet the same target handoff dropping probability by blocking fewer new calls. The individual base stations are responsible for the computations, which are shown to be simple enough to be performed in real-time. We evaluate the scheme via simulation, along with five other schemes for comparison. Simulation results show that those schemes that rely on positioning information are significantly more efficient than those that do not. Our scheme's additional use of the road topology information further improves upon this advantage, bringing the efficiency closer to the bound set by a benchmark scheme that assumes perfect knowledge about future handoffs.

#!We present the use of a Modified Generalized Hough Transform (MGHT) and deformable contours for image data retrieval where a given contour, gray-scale, or color template image can be detected in the target image, irrespective of its position, size, rotation, and smooth deformation transformations. Potential template positions are found in the target image using our novel modified Generalized Hough Transform method that takes measurements from the template features by extending a line from each edge contour point in its gradient direction to the other end of the object. The gradient difference is used to create a relationship with the orientation and length of this line segment. Potential matching positions in the target image are then searched by also extending a line from each target edge point to another end along the normal, then looking up the measurements data from the template image. Positions with high votes become candidate positions. Each candidate position is used to find a match by allowing the template to undergo a contour transformation. The deformed template contour is matched with the target by measuring the similarity in contour tangent direction and the smoothness of the matching vector. The deformation parameters are then updated via a Bayesian algorithm to find the best match. To avoid getting stuck in a local minimum solution, a novel coarse-and-fine model for contour matching is included. Results are presented for real images of several kinds including bin picking and fingerprint identification.

#!Four algorithms, all variants of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), are proposed. The original one-measurement SPSA uses an estimate of the gradient of objective function L containing an additional bias term not seen in two-measurement SPSA. As a result, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the iterate convergence process has a bias term. We propose a one-measurement algorithm that eliminates this bias, and has asymptotic convergence properties making for easier comparison with the two-measurement SPSA. The algorithm, under certain conditions, outperforms both forms of SPSA with the only overhead being the storage of a single measurement. We also propose a similar algorithm that uses perturbations obtained from normalized Hadamard matrices. The convergence w.p. 1 of both algorithms is established. We extend measurement reuse to design two second-order SPSA algorithms and sketch the convergence analysis. Finally, we present simulation results on an illustrative minimization problem.

#!Although 2DLDA algorithm obtains higher recognition accuracy, a vital unresolved problem of 2DLDA is that it needs huge feature matrix for the task of face recognition. To overcome this problem, this paper presents an efficient approach for face image feature extraction, namely, (2D)^2LDA method. Experimental results on ORL and Yale database show that the proposed method obtains good recognition accuracy despite having less number of coefficients.

#!The lack of appropriate alternative text for web images remains a problem for blind users and others accessing the web with non-visual interfaces. The content contained within web images is vital for understanding many web sites but the majority are assigned either inaccurate alternative text or none at all. The capability to automatically judge the quality of alternative text has the promise to dramatically improve the accessibility of the web by bringing intelligence to three categories of interfaces: tools that help web authors verify that they have provided adequate alternative text for web images, systems that automatically produce and insert alternative text for web images, and screen reading software. In this paper we describe a classifier capable of measuring the quality of alternative text given only a few labeled training examples by automatically considering the image context.

#!K42 is one of the few recent research projects that is examining operating system design structure issues in the context of new whole-system design. K42 is open source and was designed from the ground up to perform well and to be scalable, customizable, and maintainable. The project was begun in 1996 by a team at IBM Research. Over the last nine years there has been a development effort on K42 from between six to twenty researchers and developers across IBM, collaborating universities, and national laboratories. K42 supports the Linux API and ABI, and is able to run unmodified Linux applications and libraries. The approach we took in K42 to achieve scalability and customizability has been successful.The project has produced positive research results, has resulted in contributions to Linux and the Xen hypervisor on Power, and continues to be a rich platform for exploring system software technology. Today, K42, is one of the key exploratory platforms in the DOE's FAST-OS program, is being used as a prototyping vehicle in IBM's PERCS project, and is being used by universities and national labs for exploratory research. In this paper, we provide insight into building an entire system by discussing the motivation and history of K42, describing its fundamental technologies, and presenting an overview of the research directions we have been pursuing.

#!Progress in reconfigurable hardware technology allows the implementation of complete SoCs in today's FPGAs. In the context design for reliability, software checkpointing is an effective methodology to cope with faults. In this paper, we systematically extend the concept of checkpointing known from software systems to hardware tasks running on reconfigurable devices. We will classify different mechanisms for hardware checkpointing and present formulas for estimating the hardware overhead. Moreover, we will reveal a tool that takes over the burden of modifying hardware modules for checkpointing. Post-synthesis results of applying our methodology to different hardware accelerators will be presented and the results will be compared with the theoretical estimations.

#!In recent years, overlay networks have proven a popular way of disseminating potentially large files from a single server S to a potentially large group of N end users via the Internet. A number of algorithms and protocols have been suggested, implemented and studied. In particular, much attention has been given to peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as BitTorrent [5], Slurpie [20], SplitStream [4], Bullet [11] and Avalanche [6]. The key idea is that the file is divided into M parts of equal size and that a given user may download any one of these - or, for Avalanche, linear combinations of these - either from the server or from a peer who has previously downloaded it.

#!In this paper, we present a subdivision-inspired scheme to construct generalized Sierpinski polyhedron. Unlike usual Sierpinski polyhedra construction schemes, which create either an infinite set of disconnected tetrahedra or a non-manifold polyhedron, our robust construction scheme creates one connected and manifold polyhedron. Moreover, unlike the original schemes, this new scheme can be applied to any manifold polyhedral mesh and based on the shape of this initial polyhedra a large variety of Sierpinski polyhedra can be obtained. Our basic scheme can be viewed as applying simplest subdivision scheme [23] to an input polyhedron, but retaining old vertices. The porous structure is then obtained by removing the refined facets of the simplest subdivision.

#!Comb-drive microactuator is widely used in MEMS devices and traditionally is made of silicon as structural material using silicon-based fabrication technology. Recent development in UV lithography of SU-8 has made it possible to fabricate the ultra high aspect ratio microstructures with excellent sidewall quality. In this paper, we report a low cost alternative to the silicon-based comb drive by using cured SU-8 polymer as structural material. The microactuator was designed to have a integrated structure without assembly or bonding. A unique integration fabrication process was successfully developed based on UV lithography of SU-8 and selectively metallizing SU-8 polymer structures. Preliminary experimental results have proved the feasibility of the microactuator and the fabrication technology.

#!Certain business objectives cannot be met without the interaction and communication between different systems. An interesting concept called system of systems (SoS), which aims to describe this interaction between systems has been gaining attention in the last few years. In this paper an extensive review of the literature is performed to capture the main characteristics associated to this concept in order to propose a new, more complete definition. This paper also proposes the use of distributed simulation through the High Level Architecture (HLA) rules to model and simulate systems of systems. We illustrate our idea with two different examples, a simplified supply chain network of a computer assembly and an aircraft initial sizing scenarios. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the significant advantages distributed simulation could offer over traditional simulation for the analysis of such complex systems.

In this paper, a new fuzzy-logic-based decision-making system for stock allocation (DMS&lowbar;SA) is presented, and the objective is to achieve the target DSC fill rate whilst incurring an acceptable total holding cost, or to achieve the target holding cost whilst with a certain level of fill rate. It is shown how DMS&lowbar;SA can be extended to be applied to a multi-echelon DSC. Copyright &copy; 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

#!Time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by inhomogeneous, three-dimensional structures within a free space environment can be described by electric- and magnetic field, volume integral equations involving the free space Green function. A comprehensive set of Galerkin projection formulations (also known as moment methods) for the numerical solution of these equations is presented, together with comparative numerical results. Such formulations are widely used for particle scattering analysis, optical near field calculation, etc. Results are obtained with higher-order, divergence-and curl-conforming basis functions on iso-parametric, tetrahedral meshes. The results demonstrate that all formulations converge with similar accuracy in the case of an analytically-solvable test problem. When modeling flux densities as solution variables, it is argued that solenoidal function spaces should be used, rather than the standard divergence-conforming function spaces; this assertion is supported by the results. Some of the formulations involve solving for curl-conforming fields; such fields can be discretized with fewer unknowns than divergence-conforming ones, implying lower computational costs. Additionally, some formulations yield system matrices which are approximately halfway sparse, meaning that computational costs will be down by a factor of 2 when iterative solvers are employed, which is the case for the widely-used fast methods.

#*The operational risk tree methodology for managing operational risk exposure and measuring capital requirements
#@Henry Lee

#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index1924
#!Monte Carlo simulation is applied to measuring operational risk via a modified decision tree. The author describes a simulation based approach to measuring economic and regulatory capital for operational risk. Except in relatively rare cases where sufficient data exists, quantitative operational risk has grown to depend upon expert opinion via scenario analysis to fill in the missing data. The author explains the limitations and shortcomings of the current approach and details an alternative approach using a modified decision tree to address many of these shortcomings. While in the absence of data we still depend upon expert opinion, there is good reason to believe that the method of collecting this opinion can have great impact upon the confidence in, and reproducibility of, the results.

#!Diffusions of new products and technologies through social networks can be formalized as spreading of infectious diseases. However, while epidemiological models describe infection in terms of transmissibility, we propose a diffusion model that explicitly includes consumer decision-making affected by social influences and word-of-mouth processes. In our agent-based model consumers' probability of adoption depends on the external marketing effort and on the internal influence that each consumer perceives in his/her personal networks. Maintaining a given marketing effort and assuming its effect on the probability of adoption as linear, we can study how social processes affect diffusion dynamics and how the speed of the diffusion depends on the network structure and on consumer heterogeneity. First, we show that the speed of diffusion changes with the degree of randomness in the network. In markets with high social influence and in which consumers have a sufficiently large local network, the speed is low in regular networks, it increases in small-world networks and, contrarily to what epidemic models suggest, it becomes very low again in random networks. Second, we show that heterogeneity helps the diffusion. Ceteris paribus and varying the degree of heterogeneity in the population of agents simulation results show that the more heterogeneous the population, the faster the speed of the diffusion. These results can contribute to the development of marketing strategies for the launch and the dissemination of new products and technologies, especially in turbulent and fashionable markets.

#!Online retailing can offer several benefits. In order to realize these benefits, a commercial web site needs to ameliorate its deficiencies due to the absence of actual physical products. Although the use and popularity of the Internet continues to increase, it is still unclear how online retailers can establish effective online retailing strategies to capitalize on their benefits. For this clarification, this paper proposes a framework to categorize products according to consumers' involvement and information quality fitness. Involvement refers to the degree of psychological identification or emotional ties consumers have with a particular product. Information quality fitness refers to the extent to which a product can fit with shopper's requirements for online information. Thirty-six commercial products are empirically tested. It is found that products can be grouped into four categories such as 'complex,' 'intelligent,' 'light,' and 'simple.' This categorization can help understand product characteristics when they are sold via the Internet. Our finding implies that online retailers need to formulate their retailing strategies in view of these product categories.

#cNeural Networks
#index1949
#!To examine how the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) contributes to the decision process of the saccade direction, we recorded single-neuron activity while two monkeys performed two oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) tasks. In an ordinary ODR task, monkeys were required to make a memory-guided saccade to the cue location after a 3-s delay. In a self-selection version of the ODR task (S-ODR), four identical visual cues were presented simultaneously at the cue period, and monkeys were required to make a saccade toward any one of four directions after a 3-s delay. By comparing the same neuron's activity between two tasks, we found (1) neurons having directional cue-period activity in the ODR task did not show directionally selective activity in the S-ODR task, (2) neurons having directional pre-saccadic activity showed highly similar directional preferences in two tasks and exhibited temporal coupling between the onset of pre-saccadic activity and the initiation of saccadic eye movements, (3) neurons with directional delay-period activity in the ODR task exhibited similar directional preferences and showed gradual increase in the strength of the directional selectivity toward the end of the delay period in the S-ODR task. These results suggest that directional delay-period activity contributes to the decision process of the saccade direction in the S-ODR task, while directional cue-period and pre-saccadic activities do not. The gradual increase of the directional selectivity in delay-period activity might correspond to neural correlates of the decision process of the saccade direction in the S-ODR task.

#index1955
#!A tri-template-based codes (TTBC) method is proposed to reduce test cost of intellectual property (IP) cores. In order to reduce test data volume (TDV), the approach utilizes three templates, i.e., all 0, all 1, and the previously applied test data, for generating the subsequent test data by flipping the inconsistent bits. The approach employs a small number of test channels I to supply a large number of internal scan chains 2I-3 such that it can achieve significant reduction in test application time (TAT). Furthermore, as a non-intrusive and automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) independent solution, the approach is suitable for IP core testing because it requires neither redesign of the core under test (CUT) nor running any additional ATPG for the encoding procedure. In addition, the decoder has low hardware overhead, and its design is independent of the CUT and the given test set. Theoretical analysis and experimental results for ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits have proven the efficiency of the proposed approach.

#!This paper describes a clustering technique using Self Organizing Maps and a two-dimensional histogram of the image. The two-dimensional histogram is found using the pixel value and the mean in the neighborhood. This histogram is fed to a self organizing map that divides the histogram into regions. Carefully selecting the number of regions, a scheme that allows an optimum optical recognition of texts can be found. The algorithm is specially suited for optical recognition application where a very high degree of confidence is needed. As an example application, the algorithm has been tested in a voting application, where a high degree of precision is required. Furthermore, the algorithm can be extended to any other thresholding or clustering applications.

#!Two common data representations are mostly used in intelligent data analysis, namely the vectorial and the pairwise representation. Pairwise data which satisfy the restrictive conditions of Euclidean spaces can be faithfully translated into a Euclidean vectorial representation by embedding. Non-metric pairwise data with violations of symmetry, reflexivity or triangle inequality pose a substantial conceptual problem for pattern recognition since the amount of predictive structural information beyond what can be measured by embeddings is unclear. We show by systematic modeling of non-Euclidean pairwise data that there exists metric violations which can carry valuable problem specific information. Furthermore, Euclidean and non-metric data can be unified on the level of structural information contained in the data. Stable component analysis selects linear subspaces which are particularly insensitive to data fluctuations. Experimental results from different domains support our pattern recognition strategy.

#!We present a scheduling procedure for the wire-bonding operation of a semiconductor assembly facility. The wire-bonding operation typically consists of a large number of unrelated parallel machines and is typically one of the bottlenecks in an assembly facility. The scheduling procedure is able to handle setup times, limited fixtures (clamp&paddles) and non-zero machine ready-times (initial work in progress). It is based on a simulator that generates a schedule and a Simulated Annealing approach to optimize the schedule. Some preliminary results from an implementation in a large assembly facility are given.

#cMicrosystem Technologies
#index1998
#!Molding technologies associated with fabricating macro scale polymer components such as injection molding and hot embossing have been adapted with considerable success for fabrication of polymer microparts. While the basic principles of the process remain the same, the precision with which the processing parameters need to be controlled especially in the case of molding high aspect ratio (HAR) polymer microparts into polymer sheets is much greater than in the case of macro scale parts. It is seen that the bulk effects of the mold insert fixture and molding machine have a dominant influence on the molding parameters and that differences in material parameters such as the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymer sheets are critical for the success and typically differ from sheet to sheet. This makes it very challenging to establish standard processing parameters for hot embossing of sheet polymers. In the course of this paper, a methodology for developing a hot embossing process for HAR microstructures based on known material properties and considering the cumulative behavior of mold, material, and machine will be presented. Using this method force&#x2013;temperature&#x2013;deflection curves were measured with the intent of fine tuning the hot embossing process. Tests were carried out for different materials using a dummy mold insert yielding information that could be directly transferred to the actual mold insert with minimum development time and no risk of damage to the actual microstructures.

#!Two techniques are described for approximating distributions on the positive half-line by combinations of exponentials. One is based on Jacobi polynomial expansions, and the other on the logbeta distribution. The techniques are applied to some well-known distributions (degenerate, uniform, Pareto, lognormal and others). In theory, the techniques yield sequences of combination of exponentials that always converge to the true distribution, but their numerical performance depends on the particular distribution being approximated. An error bound is given in the case the logbeta approximations. Copyright &copy; 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

#!Despite recent advances in fluid animation, producing small-scale detail of turbulent water still remains challenging. In this paper, we extend the well-accepted particle level set method in an attempt to integrate the dynamic behavior of splashing water easily into a fluid animation system. Massless marker particles that still escape from the main body of water, in spite of the level set correction, are transformed into water particles to represent subcell-level features that are hard to capture with a limited grid resolution. These physical particles are then moved in the air through a particle simulation system that, combined with the level set, creates realistic turbulent splashing. In the rendering stage, the particle's physical properties such as mass and velocity are exploited to generate a natural appearance of water droplets and spray. In order to visualize the hybrid water, represented in both level set and water particles, we also extend a Monte Carlo ray tracer so that the particle agglomerates are smoothed, thickened, if necessary, and rendered efficiently. The effectiveness of the presented technique is demonstrated with several examples of pictures and animations.

#!We present a novel algorithm to perform continuous collision detection for articulated models. Given two discrete configurations of the links of an articulated model, we use an "arbitrary in-between motion" to interpolate its motion between two successive time steps and check the resulting trajectory for collisions. Our approach uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic bounding-volume hierarchy (D-BVH) culling based on interval arithmetic; (2) culling refinement using the swept volume of line swept sphere (LSS) and graphics hardware accelerated queries; (3) exact contact computation using OBB-trees and continuous collision detection between triangular primitives. The overall algorithm computes the time of collision, contact locations and prevents any interpenetration between the articulated model with the environment. We have implemented the algorithm and tested its performance on a 2.4 GHz Pentium PC with 1 Gbyte of RAM and a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5800 graphics card. In practice, our algorithm is able to perform accurate and continuous collision detection between articulated models and complex environments at nearly interactive rates.

#!To disseminate data to a heterogeneous body of receivers efficiently, congestion control protocols for IP multicast compose a session from several multicast groups and prescribe guidelines that enable each re ceiver to subscribe to an appropriate subset of the groups. However, a misbehaving receiver can ignore the group subscription rules and inflate its subscription to acquire unfairly high throughput. In this paper, we present the first solution for the problem of inflated subscription. Our design guards access to multicast groups with dynamic keys and consists of two independent components: DELTA (Distribution of ELigibility To Access)-a novel method for in-band distribution of group keys to receivers that are eligible to access the groups according to the congestion control protocol, and SIGMA (Secure Internet Group Management Architecture)-a generic architecture for key-based group access at edge routers. We apply DELTA and SIGMA to derive robust versions of prominent RLM and FLID-DL protocols.

#!Dendritic solidification of pure materials from an undercooled melt is studied using the extended finite element method/ level set method for modelling the thermal problem and a volume-averaged stabilized finite element formulation for modelling fluid flow. The extended finite element method using evolving enrichment functions allows accurate modelling of the discontinuous thermal conditions at the moving sharp freezing front thus capturing its motion precisely. The solution of the velocity field in the melt is obtained assuming that the sharp-interface is diffused over the length of two finite elements. The methodology presented is shown to be an effective tool for capturing the interface phenomena and freezing interface growth using a single uniform finite element grid. The whole formulation is packaged into a flexible, modular and parallel library with the ability to incorporate new physics. Comparisons with other numerical methods as well as analytical results emphasize the fidelity of the method in modelling the underlying physical phenomena and growth mechanisms. Various examples of dendritic growth in two- and three-dimensions are presented.

In particular we discuss Environmental Decision Support Systems (EDSS). In the last decade, EDSS emerged as a suitable software tool to support control decision&dash;making to maximize the performance of a system and to minimize the negative impact of faults. Knowledge Management in Environmental Decision Support Systems appear as a necessity for EDSS users to place guarantees on the system's behavior but these methodologies are still under&dash;explored.

The operating system is so full of industrial-strength routing protocols and IP innovations that those treading into the world of JUNOS will need clarification, explanation, and a showcase example or two. Look no further. This JUNOS Cookbook provides it all and more.Yes, you can mine through the 5,000 pages of documentation or take a two-thousand-dollar training course, but JUNOS's interprocess sophistication can be baffling unless you know the shortcuts and tricks, as well as those rays of illuminating comprehension that can come only from those who live with it. JUNOS Cookbook is the first comprehensive book about JUNOS software and it provides over 200 time-saving step-by-step techniques including discussions about the processes and alternative ways to perform the same task. It's been tested and tech-reviewed by field engineers who know how to take JUNOS out for a spin and it's applicable to the entire line of M-, T-, and J-series routers. JUNOS Cookbook will not only pay for itself the first few times you use it, it will make your network easier to manage and update. "Aviva Garrett has done a tremendous job of distilling the features of JUNOS software in a form that will be useful for a wide audience-students, field engineers, network architects, and other networking professionals alike will benefit from this book. For many people, this is the only book on JUNOS they will need." Pradeep Sindhu, CTO and Founder, Juniper Networks"This cookbook is superb. Aviva Garrett has masterfully assembled a complete set of practical real-world examples with step-by-step instructions. Security, management, routing: it's all here!"

#!Energy efficiency becomes increasingly important in today's high-performance storage systems. It can be challenging to save energy and improve performance at the same time in conventional (i.e. single-rotation-rate) disk-based storage systems. Most existing solutions compromise performance for energy conservation. In this paper, we propose a redundancy-based, two-level I/O cache architecture called RIMAC to address this problem. The idea of RIMAC is to enable data on the standby disk to be recovered by accessing data in the two-level I/O cache or on currently active/idle disks. At both cache and disk levels, RIMAC dynamically transforms accesses toward standby disks by exploiting parity redundancy in parity-based redundant disk arrays. Because I/O requests that require physical accesses on standby disks involve long waiting time and high power consumption for disk spin-up (tens of seconds for SCSI disks), transforming those requests to accesses in a two-level, collaborative I/O cache or on active disks can significantly improve both energy efficiency and performance.In RIMAC, we developed i) two power-aware read request transformation schemes called Transformable Read in Cache (TRC) and Transformable Read on Disk (TRD), ii) a power-aware write request transformation policy for parity update and iii) a second-chance parity cache replacement algorithm to improve request transformation rate. We evaluated RIMAC by augmenting a validated storage system simulator, disksim. For several real-life server traces including HP's cello 99, TPC-D and SPC's search engine, RIMAC is shown to reduce energy consumption by up to 33% and simultaneously improve the average response time by up to 30%.

#*Performance of Super-Orthogonal Convolutional Coding for Ultra-Wideband Systems in Multipath and Multiuser Channels
#@Tomoko Matsumoto,Ryuji Kohno

#index2059
#%603912
#!This paper investigates the application of super-orthogonal convolutional codes (SOCC) to a direct-sequence based ultra- wideband (DS-UWB) system under a realistic environment including inter-symbol interference (ISI) and multiuser interference (MUI). The effect of MUI and ISI on the performance of SOCC is analyzed by using both maximum ratio combining (MRC) RAKE receiver and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) RAKE receiver followed by matched filter receiver. The analysis shows that in the case of employing simple MRC-RAKE receiver, the performance of SOCC is ffected by MUI and ISI because of the short length of the spreading sequence. In order to combat MUI and ISI, a code-hopping scheme is proposed in conjunction with SOCC. The results show that SOCC scheme outperforms the higher-rate conventional convolutional coded scheme for multipath and multiple access channels. Furthermore, the use of MMSE-RAKE receiver to suppress interference is analyzed and the subsequent increase of the system capacity is observed.

#!Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is gaining a lot of attention these days, as more companies and individuals switch from standard telephone service to phone service via the Internet. The reason is simple: A single network to carry voice and data is easier to scale, maintain, and administer. As an added bonus, it's also cheaper, because VoIP is free of the endless government regulations and tariffs imposed upon phone companies. VoIP is simply overflowing with hack potential, and VoIP Hacks is the practical guide from O'Reilly that presents these possibilities to you. It provides dozens of hands-on projects for building a VoIP network, showing you how to tweak and customize a multitude of exciting things to get the job done. Along the way, you'll also learn which standards and practices work best for your particular environment. Among the quick and clever solutions showcased in the book are those for: gauging VoIP readiness on an enterprise network using SIP, H.323, and other signaling specifications providing low-layer security in a VoIP environment employing IP hardphones, analog telephone adapters, and softPBX servers dealing with and avoiding the most common VoIP deployment mistakes In reality, VoIP Hacks contains only a small subset of VoIP knowledge-enough to serve as an introduction to the world of VoIP and teach you how to use it to save money, be more productive, or just impress your friends. If you love to tinker and optimize, this is the one technology, and the one book, you must investigate.

#!We consider a fundamental scheduling problem in a multiserver stochastic network consisting of 2 classes of customers and 2 classes of servers. Customers of class k arrive to queue k according to a Poisson process with rate &lambda;k, k = 1, 2. The service times of class k customers at class &ell; servers are i.i.d. following an exponential distribution with mean &mu;k&ell;-1, &forall;k, &ell; = 1, 2, where 0 < &mu;11, &mu;12, &mu;22 < &infin; and &mu;21 = 0. Hence, class 1 customers can be served at both classes of servers, but class 2 customers can only be served at class 2 servers. A FCFS queueing discipline is employed at each queue. The customer arrival and service processes are mutually independent of each other and of all resource allocation decisions.

#!Dialogue systems for health communication hold out the promise of providing intelligent assistance to patients through natural interfaces that require no training to use. But in order to make the development of such systems cost effective, we must be able to use generic techniques and components which are then specialized as needed to the specific health problem and patient population. In this paper, we describe Chester, a prototype intelligent assistant that interacts with its user via conversational natural spoken language to provide them with information and advice regarding their prescribed medications. Chester builds on our prior experience constructing conversational assistants in other domains. The emphasis of this paper is on the portability of our generic spoken dialogue technology, and presents a case study of the application of these techniques to the development of a dialogue system for health communication.

#!We describe the results of numerical experiments evaluating the efficiency of variance estimators based on integrated sample paths. The idea behind the estimators is to compute a vector of integrated paths and combine them to form an estimator of the time-average variance constant that is used, for example, in the construction of confidence intervals. When used in conjunction with batching, the approach generalizes the method of non-overlapping batch means. Compared with non-overlapping batch means, the estimators require longer to compute, have smaller variance and larger bias. We show that for long enough simulation run lengths, the efficiency (the reciprocal of running time multiplied by mean-squared error) of integrated path estimators can be much greater than that of non-overlapping batch means; the numerical experiments show an efficiency improvement by up to a factor of ten.

#!The cascade of two baseline networks in tandem is a rearrangeable network. The cascade of two omega networks appended with a certain interconnection pattern is also rearrangeable. These belong to the general problem: for what banyan-type network (i.e., bit-permuting unique-routing network) is the tandem cascade a rearrangeable network? We relate the problem to the trace and guide of banyan-type networks. Let τ denote the trace permutation of a 2n × 2n banyan-type network and γ the guide permutation of it. This paper proves that rearrangeability of the tandem cascade of the network is solely determined by the transposition τγ-1. Such a permutation is said to be tandem rearrangeable when the tandem cascade is indeed rearrangeable. We identify a few tandem rearrangeable permutations, each implying the rearrangeability of the tandem cascade of a wide class of banyan-type networks.

#!We investigate the effect of curvature on the accuracy of schemes used to transfer loads along the interface in coupled fluid-solid simulations involving non-matching meshes. We analyze two types of load transfer schemes for the coupled system: (a) point-to-element projection schemes and (b) common-refinement schemes. The accuracy of these schemes over the curved interface is assessed with the aid of static and transient problems. We show that the point-to-element projection schemes may yield inaccurate load transfer from the source fluid mesh to the target solid mesh, leading to a weak instability in the form of spurious oscillations and overshoots in the interface solution. The common-refinement scheme resolves this problem by providing an accurate transfer of discrete interface conditions across non-matching meshes. We show theoretically that the accurate transfer preserves the stability of the coupled system while maintaining the energy conservation over a reference interface. Finally, we introduce simple analytical error functions which correlate well with the numerical errors of the load transfer schemes.

#!This paper discusses a research project in which social scientists were involved both as analysts and supporters during a pilot with a new wireless nursing call system. The case thus exemplifies an attempt to participate in developing dependable health care systems and offers insight into the challenges of developing and supporting such systems. The analysis proposes that while dependability is not simply a technical issue, neither is it something, which can be improved merely by adding a social dimension. Instead, it argues that dependability is a relative concept, which may mean different things conditional on how it is specified in practice and who gets to do this. This relativity makes it important to relate the question of how to support dependable health care systems to an analysis of both the politics of technology within specific projects and to the politics of discourse, through which the researcher becomes involved in such projects.

#!With the advent of next-generation, bandwidth-intensive multimedia applications such as HDTV, interactive distance learning, and movie broadcasts from studios, it is becoming imperative to exploit the enormous bandwidth promised by the rapidly growing wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) technology. These applications require multicasting of information from a source to several destination nodes which should be performed judiciously to conserve expensive network resources. In this study, we investigate two switch architectures to support multicasting in a WDM network: one using an opaque (optical-electronic-optical approach and the other using a transparent (all-optical) approach. For both these switch architectures, we present mathematical formulations for routing and wavelength assignment of several light-tree-based multicast sessions on a given network topology at a globally optimal cost. We expand our work to also accommodate: 1) fractional-capacity sessions (where a session's capacity is a fraction of a wavelength channel's bandwidth, thereby leading to "traffic-groomed" multicast sessions) and 2) sparse splitting constraints, i.e., limited fanout of optical splitters and limited number of such splitters at each node. We illustrate the solutions obtained on different networks by solving these optimization problems, which turn out to be mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). Because the MILP is computationally intensive and does not scale well for large problem sizes, we also propose fast heuristics for establishing a set of multicast sessions in a network with or without wavelength converters and with fractional-capacity sessions. We find that, for all scenarios, the heuristics which arrange the sessions in ascending order with respect to destination set size and/or cost perform better in terms of network resource usage than the heuristics which arrange the sessions in descending order.

#!The quest for reliable integration of initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a long-standing problem in numerical analysis. At one end of the reliability spectrum are fixed stepsize methods implemented using standard floating point, where the onus lies entirely with the user to ensure the stepsize chosen is adequate for the desired accuracy. At the other end of the reliability spectrum are rigorous interval-based methods, that can provide provably correct bounds on the error of a numerical solution. This rigour comes at a price, however: interval methods are generally two to three orders of magnitude more expensive than fixed stepsize floating-point methods. Along the spectrum between these two extremes lie various methods of different expense that estimate and control some measure of the local errors and adjust the stepsize accordingly. In this article, we continue previous investigations into a class of interpolants for use in Runge-Kutta methods that have a defect function whose qualitative behavior is asymptotically independent of the problem being integrated. In particular the point, in a step, where the maximum defect occurs as h &rarr; 0 is known a priori. This property allows the defect to be monitored and controlled in an efficient and robust manner even for modestly large stepsizes. Our interpolants also have a defect with the highest possible order given the constraints imposed by the order of the underlying discrete formula. We demonstrate the approach on three Runge-Kutta methods of orders 5, 6, and 8, and provide Fortran and preliminary Matlab interfaces to these three new integrators. We also consider how sensitive such methods are to roundoff errors. Numerical results for four problems on a range of accuracy requests are presented.

#!We discussed previously the need for a risk analysis tool which could account simultaneously for the variety of hazards produced by the explosion of a space launch vehicle. We particularly argued that by analyzing separately the risks posed by the pressure of the explosion blast, the dispersion of toxic gases and the fragments cloud, current practices fail to account for the interdependencies between those hazards, potentially miscalculating the overall risk on the public and the surrounding infrastructure. In this work we set two objectives to expand on our claim. The first is to propose a methodology based on Distribution Envelope Determination (DEnv) to address the above need. The second on the other hand focuses on describing the ongoing software development activities aimed at implementing this methodology as an ArcGIS platform component.

There are three query processing methods in the database broadcasting system: (i) the server processes a query and then broadcasts the query result to the client, (ii) the client stores all data that are necessary to process the query and then processes it locally, and (iii) the server and the client collaborate in processing the query. Since the performance of each method changes according to the situation such as the interval of query generation and the size of query results, it is difficult to choose the optimal method among them statically. In this paper, we propose new query processing methods which dynamically change the order of queries submitted in the queue at the server and also change processing methods for the queries according to the deadline of queries and the system situation. These methods improve the success rate as well as reduce the response time in most cases. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!Today more and more essential processes are conducted across enterprise borders, inducing additional challenges in terms of different languages, process types and ontology. Business Process Modelling (BPM) and Simulation are well-understood methods to analyze and optimize the processes within an enterprise. However, they can also be used for cross-organizational application, especially if they are combined with reference structures. This paper explains techniques which support cross-enterprise design and configuration based on Reference Models. Thereby, different approaches such as SCOR, the Integrated Enterprise Modelling (IEM) and a specific Distributed Simulation Method are used and integrated into a consistent Reference Model approach. The application of this approach is illustrated with different projects which each focus on a specific aspect of the supply chain design and configuration.

#!Clustering algorithms are routinely used in biomedical disciplines, and are a basic tool in bioinformatics. Depending on the task at hand, there are two most popular options, the central partitional techniques and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering techniques and their derivatives. These methods are well studied and well established. However, both categories have some drawbacks related to data dimensionality (for partitional algorithms) and to the bottom-up structure (for hierarchical agglomerative algorithms). To overcome these limitations, motivated by the problem of gene expression analysis with DNA microarrays, we present a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a completely different principle, which is the analysis of shared farthest neighbors. We present a framework for clustering using ranks and indexes, and introduce the shared farthest neighbors (SFN) clustering criterion. We illustrate the properties of the method and present experimental results on different data sets, using the strategy of evaluating data clustering by extrinsic knowledge given by class labels.

#!Welcome to WOSP'07 in the beautiful city of Buenos Aires!WOSP'07 is a venue for active interchange of ideas from people working in various fields of computing and telecommunications. Focusing on the intersection of software and performance, this international workshop brings together software engineers, developers, performance analysts and modelers who study, create and use tools and methods that address the new issues in the field of software performance. Modern distributed applications, often based on mobility, with heterogeneous and intermittent connections, add unforeseen challenges every day, and demand new approaches for modeling and analyzinge the performance characteristics of design alternatives in all the phases of the software lifecycle. However, this achievingement the goal is often defied often challenging by because of increasing system complexity, rapidly evolving software technologies, short time to market, incomplete documentation, and poorly defined requirements.WOSP'07 is the sixth in the series of International Workshop on Software and Performance that began in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1998. This year the workshop is being held for the first time in South America, and we are fortunate to have it in Argentina. We hope you will take the time to enjoy the city in addition to the workshop. Therefore, welcome to WOSP'07 in the beautiful city of Buenos Aires!This year's technical program is as strong as ever. We received 39 submissions which were thoroughly reviewed by an expert program committee. From these 13 were accepted as full papers, 4 were accepted as experience papers and 8 as short papers. The workshop will be is structured in 8 sessions over covering 3 days. Session topics span from a range of domains including Software Performance Modeling and Engineering, through Resource-Awareness to and Performance of Mobile Systems. Two sessions will be dedicated to short papers. We are confident that the body of knowledge selected for WOSP'07 will contribute, on one hand, to the advancement of the state of the art in the field and, on the other hand, to filling the gap between the academic and industrial worlds. Only theise synergy between these two worlds may allow can ensure that to software performance modeling and analysis to will become stable standard practices in the software development processes.In addition to papers, the workshop includes tutorials and working sessions. We are also pleased to have two distinguished keynote speakers, that are: Dr. Rich Friedrich from HP and Dr. Carlo Ghezzi from Politecnico di Milano.

#!While moving our fingertip over a fine surface we experience a sensation that gives us an idea of its properties. A satisfactory simulation of this feeling is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we describe a rendering strategy based on vibrations that play an important role in the tactile exploration of fine surfaces. To produce appropriate excitation patterns we use an array of vibrating contactor pins. Similar to the colour model in computer graphics, we simulate arbitrary vibrations as a superposition of only two sinewaves. Each sinewave is intended for the excitation of a specific population of mechanoreceptors. We carried out first tests of our rendering strategy on Brownian surfaces of different fractal dimensions.

#!We introduce a method for constructing optimally universal hash families and equivalently RBIBDs. As a consequence of our construction we obtain minimal optimally universal hash families, if the cardinalities of the universe and the range are powers of the same prime. A corollary of this result is that the necessary conditions for the existence of an RBIBD with parameters v, k, λ, namely v ≡ 0 (mod k) and λ(v - 1) ≡ 0(mod k - 1), are sufficient, if v and k are powers of the same prime. As an application of our construction, we show that the k-MAXCUT algorithm of Hofmeister and Lefmann [A combinatorial design approach to MAXCUT, Random Struct. Algorithms 9 (1996) 163-173] can be implemented such that it has a polynomial running time, in the case that the number of vertices and k are powers of the same prime.

#!The mobility of the nodes in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a crucial factor in the performance studies of communication protocols for these kind of networks. For this reason, researchers usually use a randomized node movement model, such as the Random Way-Point Model [6], in the process of designing or analyzing the behavior of their protocols. Since movement is not very predictable in these scenarios, they generally serve as a "worst case assumption" of node mobility concerning communication protocol performance in the sense that a positive correlation between performance in an RWP scenario and an arbitrary scenario exists. Additionally, RWP is an analytically well-understood mobility scheme and the movements can be generated very easily with tools complementary to most of the common network simulators.

#!In this paper, we propose a new approach for mitigation of worm propagation through tactical Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) which is based upon performance signatures and software rejuvenation. Three application performance signature and software rejuvenation algorithms are proposed and analyzed. These algorithms monitor critical applications' responsiveness and trigger actions for software rejuvenation when host resources degrade due to a co-resident worm competing for host resources. We analyze the effectiveness of our algorithms through analytic modeling and detailed, extensive simulation studies. The key performance metrics investigated are application response time, mean time between rejuvenations and the steady state probability of host infection. We also use simulation models to investigate several design and parameter tuning issues. We investigate the relationship between the rate at which the application performance monitors can detect out-of-specification applications and the rate of worm propagation in the network.

#!Incorporating user-oriented features usually found only in much larger computers, the first models of the Eclipse line, the $100 and $200, use a high speed micro-programmed central processor, and can run with either; core or semiconductor memories, or both. The core and semiconductor memories are available with an error detection and correction feature that can find and correct; single bit errors caused by the computer. The semiconductor memories use a high-speed cache to increase memory speed. The Eclipse $100, the smaller of the two computers, will be used by oems or by end users who need a smaller system to meet their requirements. The Eclipse $100 is 5-1/4 inches high, and holds six standard Data General printed circuit boards. It costs $9200, with 16k bytes of core memory, and $10,700 with 16k bytes of semiconductor memory. Eclipse $100 deliveries will begin in December. The Eclipse $200, a system-oriented computer that can hold 16 printed circuit boards, will be used by system builders or end users who will build large scale computing systems around it. The Eclipse $200 is 10-1/2 inches high, and costs $16,300 with 32k bytes of core memory, and $19,300 with 32k bytes of semiconductor memory. Deliveries of the Eclipse $200 will begin in February. The instruction set of both Eclipse computers is microprogrammed in the central processor. There are over 40 new instruction in the Eclipse computers. Programs written on Nova computers will run on either the Eclipse $100 or $200. The central processor includes a Writeable Control Store making up to 256, 56-bit words available to write specialized micro-programmed instructions. The instruction set is enhanced to help programmers writing in assembly language or high-level language programs. Hardware memory stacks, supported by comprehensive instructions, make programming more efficient, while block, word, byte and bit manipulation instructions improve system performance. Instructions are both single word and double word instructions.

#!The popularity of digital cameras continues to grow exponentially. They are now more powerful, feature rich, and affordable--turning digital photography into a mainstream interest. And with Photoshop Elements, Adobe has created the most popular photo-editing program on the planet. Learning how to work Photoshop Elements and manage digital photos can be a challenge for anyone just getting started--from the hobbyist to the pro photographer. With the latest Photoshop Elements 4 update, Adobe delivers a powerful new program that provides photo editing and organizing functionality with improved performance. The updated version also includes new, more intuitive features that are streamlined and easier to use--when the photographer has the right learning tool in hand. With Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual, author Barbara Brundage has written the perfect digital photography guide. In a clear, easy-to-read format, the author provides step-by-step instruction so readers can learn what they need to do to edit their photos successfully and manage their collection. This new edition also includes more than a dozen downloadable images so readers can practice using the editing tools. Readers will master useful editing techniques--from the most common to the advanced:Automatically correct red eye and skin tonesSelect and extract complex objects with the Magic Selection Brush and The Magic ExtractorCreate photomontagesRestore old photographsPost photos on the webManage and archive an entire collectionDesign a custom slide show with panning and zooming capabilitiesOnce photographers learn how to edit their photos successfully, they'll also learn how to post them online or upload them to the Kodak EasyShare Gallery for use in creating personal mailing lists, post cards, calendars, and much more. Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual, is for any photographer interested in learning the right editing techniques for producing and sharing beautiful digital photography.Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual covers the Windows version of the software only. When we published the book, there was no Mac version of the software (as there is now), and for various reasons, we've been unable to update this edition to include the Mac version. Nonetheless, if you're on a Mac, you can use this book. Just substitute Command for Ctrl, and Option for Alt whenever you see keystroke shortcuts, and about 98 percent of the Editor functions will work the same. The sections on the Organizer only apply to Windows because the Mac version has no Organizer.

#*Discovering Interesting Relationships among Deep Web Databases: A Source-Biased Approach
#@James Caverlee,Ling Liu,Daniel Rocco

#cWorld Wide Web
#index2281
#!The escalation of deep web databases has been phenomenal over the last decade, spawning a growing interest in automated discovery of interesting relationships among available deep web databases. Unlike the "surface" web of static pages, these deep web databases provide data through a web-based query interface and account for a huge portion of all web content. This paper presents a novel source-biased approach to efficiently discover interesting relationships among web-enabled databases on the deep web. Our approach supports a relationship-centric view over a collection of deep web databases through source-biased database analysis and exploration. Our source-biased approach has three unique features: First, we develop source-biased probing techniques, which allow us to determine in very few interactions whether a target database is relevant to the source database by probing the target with very precise probes. Second, we introduce source-biased relevance metrics to evaluate the relevance of deep web databases discovered, to identify interesting types of source-biased relationships for a collection of deep web databases, and to rank them accordingly. The source-biased relationships discovered not only present value-added metadata for each deep web database but can also provide direct support for personalized relationship-centric queries. Third, but not least, we also develop a performance optimization using source-biased probing with focal terms to further improve the effectiveness of the basic source-biased model. A prototype system is designed for crawling, probing, and supporting relationship-centric queries over deep web databases using the source-biased approach. Our experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed source-biased analysis and discovery model, showing that the source-biased approach outperforms query-biased probing and unbiased probing.

#!The microprogrammed Data General Eclipse S/200 computer is available with a writable control store (WCS). The WCS feature of the Eclipse is an extension of the microprogrammed control logic of the computer's central processing unit. It allows a user to implement specialized instructions at a very low level. Its use is however, discouraged since Data General does not provide software support for the WCS feature. A microassembler was written to alleviate this problem on the Memphis State System.

#*Embedded Image Coding Using Context Adaptive Wavelet Difference Reduction
#@Poonlap Lamsrichan,Teerapat Sanguankotchakorn
#t2007
#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index2285
#!It is well-known that one of the best wavelet-based image compression techniques, called Wavelet Difference Reduction--WDR, has both simple algorithm and comparative rate-distortion results comparing to other coders in the literature. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to enhance the performance of WDR coder in a very efficient way. The methodology is highly based on the context adaptive model. High-order statistical context modeling is used for significant coefficients prediction by scanning order adaptation of WDR. In binary mode, the coder is clearly better than Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT). A new conditional Arithmetic Coding (AC) using array of contexts is specifically designed for WDR-based coder. Based on our simulation results of all images in the test set which covers various types of images, it is apparent that our proposed coder in AC mode generates the rate-distortion results that are superior to those of all other WDR-based coders in the literature. Furthermore, it is very competitive to SPIHT-AC and JPEG2000, the best coders, at all bit rates.

#!This paper reports on an evaluation of the usability designer role as applied in two Swedish systems development organisations. The role was initially defined by us, but evolved in these two organisations. We conducted interviews with usability designers, project managers and a user representative. Our main research question was whether or not the introduction of a usability designer has been successful in terms of changes in the systems development process and the impact the role has had on products, projects and organisations. To some extent, the role has met our expectations and intentions for instance, in helping the usability designers shift their focus towards design, and assume some kind of ''users' advocate'' role. But in other ways, the role ''failed''. The usability designers in our study are still facing the kind of problems and obstacles that usability professionals have always had to deal with.

#!The key to mastering any Unix system, especially Linux and Mac OS X, is a thorough knowledge of shell scripting. Scripting is a way to harness and customize the power of any Unix system, and it's an essential skill for any Unix users, including system administrators and professional OS X developers. But beneath this simple promise lies a treacherous ocean of variations in Unix commands and standards. bash Cookbook teaches shell scripting the way Unix masters practice the craft. It presents a variety of recipes and tricks for all levels of shell programmers so that anyone can become a proficient user of the most common Unix shell -- the bash shell -- and cygwin or other popular Unix emulation packages. Packed full of useful scripts, along with examples that explain how to create better scripts, this new cookbook gives professionals and power users everything they need to automate routine tasks and enable them to truly manage their systems -- rather than have their systems manage them.

#!This paper presents a novel anomaly detection and clustering algorithm for the network intrusion detection based on factor analysis and Mahalanobis distance. Factor analysis is used to uncover the latent structure of a set of variables. The Mahalanobis distance is used to determine the "similarity" of a set of values from an "unknown" sample to a set of values measured from a collection of "known" samples. By utilizing factor analysis and Mahalanobis distance, we developed an algorithm 1) to identify outliers based on a trained model, and 2) to cluster attacks by abnormal features.

#!This paper presents the development and the application of simulation models for air cargo terminal operations. As air cargo volume is fast increasing in recent years, air cargo terminals which handle cargos for carriers face challenges to streamline their operations. Air cargo terminals employ diverse storage media and are also equipped with various material handling equipments. Due to the complex and stochastic nature of terminal operations, which makes formulation of analytical model difficult, in this study, simulation models are developed to analyze the air cargo terminal operations. We first employ timed CPN (Colour Petri nets) to model the terminal operations, and then the corresponding simulation model will be developed. In order to validate this simulation model, we run the model based on actual cargo retrieval schedules obtained from an air cargo terminal. The results show that this model provides a good estimate of the terminal performance. The model is then employed to analyze the performance of the airline assignment policy for the objective of minimizing the cargo processing times, and the results show that the proposed policy significantly improves the operational performance of air cargo terminals. Second, the simulation model is employed to analyze the performance of an AS/ RS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System), and the performance of the proposed storage policy is compared with that of the current policy. The simulation experiment also validates the optimal parameter value from the analytic model. The developed models simulate air cargo terminal operations effectively and efficiently, and will aid future studies in the design and control of terminal operations.

You can upgrade the hard drive for more hours of recording, log in to the serial port for command-line access to programming data, log files, closed-captioning data, display graphics on the TiVo screen, and even play MP3s. Note: Not all TiVos are the same. The original TiVo, the Series 1, is the most hackable TiVo out there; it's a box thrown together with commodity parts and the TiVo code is running on open hardware. The Series 2 TiVo, the most commonly sold TiVo today, is not open. You won't see hacks in this book that involve modifying Series 2 software.

#!Dynamic data-driven application systems (DDDAS) integrate computer simulations with experimental observations to study phenomena with greater speed and accuracy than could be achieved by either experimentation or simulation alone. One of the key challenges behind DDDAS is automatically adapting simulations when experimental data indicates that a simulation must change. Coercion is a semi-automated simulation adaptation approach that can be automated further if elements of the simulation called flexible points are described in advance. In this paper, we use a number of DDDAS adaptation examples to identify the information that needs to be captured about flexible points in order to support coercion.

Shadowing can thus be used as a form of backward error analysis for numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations. This survey introduces the reader to shadowing with a detailed tour of shadowing algorithms and practical results obtained over the last 15 years.

#!In this paper, a novel parametric and global image histogram thresholding method is presented. It is based on the estimation of the statistical parameters of ''object'' and ''background'' classes by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, under the assumption that these two classes follow a generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution. The adoption of such a statistical model as an alternative to the more common Gaussian model is motivated by its attractive capability to approximate a broad variety of statistical behaviors with a small number of parameters. Since the quality of the solution provided by the iterative EM algorithm is strongly affected by initial conditions (which, if inappropriately set, may lead to unreliable estimation), a robust initialization strategy based on genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed. Experimental results obtained on simulated and real images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

#index2384
#!Traditionally, inventory problems for the vendor and the buyer are treated separately. In modern enterprises, however, the integration of vendor---buyer inventory system is an important issue. This co-operative approach to inventory management contributes to the success of supply chain management by minimizing the joint inventory cost. The joint inventory cost and the response time can further be reduced when the buyer orders and the vendor replenishes the required items just in time (JIT) for their consumption. The inclusion of the JIT concept in this model contributes significantly to a joint inventory cost reduction. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis are carried out. The derived results show an impressive cost reduction when compared with Goyal's model.

#!Content access control within hierarchies is an ubiquitous problem. It occurs each time that a set of users have access to a set of resources. The users do not have necessarily the same access rights. Allowing users to access only resources to which they are entitled in a scalable and efficient way is the objective of our key management scheme. In this paper, we introduce the hierarchical group communication, give an abstract model of the hierarchical group communication. We present and classify the most important works on key management for hierarchical groups from the multicast and information technology communities. Then, we propose an efficient operational solution to implement the hierarchical group communication model and proof its security and proof its security.

#!The second book in this acclaimed series from noted photographer and digital imaging expert Eddie Tapp delves into color management, a topic that has needlessly become a mystery to experienced digital photographers, whether they're avid amateurs, serious students, or working professionals. With his easygoing yet authoritative style, Eddie sheds light on this topic and supplies an understanding of color management that readers apply to their own work. Clear and concise, this highly visual book explains how color management is a part of the overall photographic workflow. Eddie demonstrates the three stages of color managed workflow, from choosing a color space, to calibrating your devices, to applying appropriate profiles, and shows you exactly what you need to know and why you need to know it. Color management scientist Rick Lucas contributes a chapter on the hard-core technical aspects. Other books on color management are much too long, involved and intimidating. This absorbing book sets the right tone and supplies you with key answers quickly. Our Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography book series brings you the focused knowledge you need on specific areas of digital photography. Acknowledged as one of the premier trainers of digital imaging in the world, Eddie brings his teaching experience to bear on issues that other books gloss over or bury under general coverage. Now, you don't have to buy a doorstop-sized book to get the key information you need on color management, efficient workflow, or a variety of other specific digital imaging topics. Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography also covers workflow setup; advanced and professional production techniques; controlling digital color and tone; creative enhancement techniques; and more. This series is a perfect complement to O'Reilly's general list on Photoshop and digital photography, and offers you focused books that cover technical issues at prices that are affordable and solutions that are quickly accessible. We're thrilled that Eddie Tapp has finally agreed to publish books -- and with O'Reilly. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright © 2010 ACM, Inc.

#!Predicting the protein structure from an amino acid sequence is computationally very intensive. In order to speed up protein sequence matching and processing, we present a novel coprocessor architecture for fast protein structure prediction. The architecture consists of systolic arrays to speed up the data intensive sequence alignment and structure prediction steps, and finite state machines for the control dominated steps. The architecture has been synthesized using Synopsys DC Compiler in 0.18 micron CMOS technology and details of its area and timing performance have been provided. A procedure to develop architectures with area-time trade-offs has also been presented.

#!This paper addresses the problem of creating a postmortem identification system by matching image features extracted from dental radiographs. We lay the architecture of a prototype automated dental identification system (ADIS), which tackles the dental image matching problem by first extracting high-level features to expedite retrieval of potential matches and then by low-level image comparison using inherent features of dental images. We propose the use of learnable inherent dental image features for tooth-to-tooth image comparisons. We treat the tooth-to-tooth matching problem as a binary classification problem for which we propose probabilistic models of class-conditional densities. We also propose an adaptive strategic searching technique and use it in conjunction with back propagation in order to estimate system parameters. We present promising experimental results that reflect the value of our approach.

#!Network Management FundamentalsA guide to understanding how network management technology really worksAlexander Clemm, Ph.D.Network management is an essential factor in successfully operating a network. As a company becomes increasingly dependent on networking services, keeping those services running is synonymous with keeping the business running. Network Management Fundamentals provides you with an accessible overview of network management covering management not just of networks themselves but also of services running over those networks.Network Management Fundamentals explains the different technologies that are used in network management and how they relate to each other. The book focuses on fundamental concepts and principles. It provides a solid technical foundation for the practitioner to successfully navigate network management topics and apply those concepts to particular situations.The book is divided into four parts: Part I provides an overview of what network management is about and why it is relevant. It also conveys an informal understanding of the functions, tools, and activities that are associated with it. Part II examines network management from several different angles, culminating in a discussion of how these aspects are combined into management reference models. Part III provides more detail into different building blocks of network management introduced in Part II, such as management protocols, management organization, and management communication patterns.ï¾ Part IV rounds out the book with a number of management topics of general interest, including management integration and service-level management.Dr. Alexander Clemm is a senior architect with Cisco®. He has been involved with integrated management of networked systems and services since 1990. He has provided technical leadership for many leading-edge network management development, architecture, and engineering efforts from original conception to delivery to the customer, and he has also served as technical program co-chair of the 2005 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management. Grasp the business implications of network management Examine different management reference models, such as Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) Understand the building blocks of network management and their purposes Assess the implications and impact of management technologies and put them in perspective Prepare for decisions about network management that require an understanding of the “big picture”This book is part of the Cisco Press® Fundamentals Series.

#!Anyone who plugs in a Mac whether it's the proud owner of the very latest version or someone still tapping away on yesterday's model usually finds these machines to be an immensely popular and beneficial tool. Unfortunately, they can also be a royal pain in the neck. Any way you slice it, Macs still have a tendency to induce minor headaches at the most inopportune times. Mac Annoyances feels your pain. Developed precisely for the individual who can't live without a Mac yet can't deal with its fickle temperament Mac Annoyances provides solutions to scores of common problems faced by Mac owners. Contained within its pages are hidden (plus well-documented) tips, tricks, and workarounds designed to drastically improve specific problem-solving capabilities. The result: a significant enhancement of the overall user experience and a tremendous savings of time no matter which version you own. What does Mac Annoyances cover? What doesn't it cover is the more appropriate question. Hassles associated with Mac OS X, iLife, Mac hardware, and Microsoft Office (the mother of all annoyances) are all addressed in sharp detail. Also tackled: how to overcome problems related to specific applications such as iTunes, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Apple's Mail program. Having trouble browsing the Web or searching with Google? Want to make your Mac a bit faster? Keyboard causing you trouble? These and dozens more annoyances like them are all dissected as well. Truth is, if you've experienced it, Mac Annoyances addresses it. Written by top-flight author and renowned Mac expert, John Rizzo, this book is a follow-up to the bestselling PC Annoyances. In keeping with the spirit of O'Reilly's Annoyances series, Rizzo adopts a sympathetic tone throughout the book that quickly ingratiates itself to readers. Rather than blaming Mac owners for possessing minimal technical savvy, Mac Annoyances takes them along for a fun-filled ride as they join forces and outsmart the system together.

#index2445
#!Consider a performance measure that is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation where input distributions to the underlying model may involve two stage sampling. The settings of interest include the case where in the first stage physical samples from the distribution are collected. In the second stage, Monte Carlo sampling is done from the observed empirical distribution. We also consider the sampling-importance resampling (SIR) algorithm. Here it is difficult to sample directly from the desired input distribution, and these samples are generated in two stages. In the first stage, a large number of samples are generated from a distribution convenient from the sampling viewpoint. In the second stage, a resampling is done from the samples generated in the first stage so that asymptotically the new samples have the desired distribution. We discuss how to allocate computational and other effort optimally the two stages to minimize the estimator's resultant mean square error.

Our model is the first to capture both identity-dependent and pose-dependent shape variation in a correlated fashion, enabling creation of a variety of virtual human characters with realistic and non-linear body deformations that are customized to the individual. Our learning method is robust to irregular sampling in pose-space and identity-space, and also to missing surface data in the examples. Our synthesized character models are based on standard skinning techniques and can be rendered in real time.

#!“Companies have been implementing large agile projects for a number of years, but the 'stigma' of 'agile only works for small projects' continues to be a frequent barrier for newcomers and a rallying cry for agile critics. What has been missing from the agile literature is a solid, practical book on the specifics of developing large projects in an agile way. Dean Leffingwell's book Scaling Software Agility fills this gap admirably. It offers a practical guide to large project issues such as architecture, requirements development, multi-level release planning, and team organization. Leffingwell's book is a necessary guide for large projects and large organizations making the transition to agile development.” ï¾Jim Highsmith, director, Agile Practice, Cutter Consortium, author of Agile Project Management “There's tension between building software fast and delivering software that lasts, between being ultra-responsive to changes in the market and maintaining a degree of stability. In his latest work, Scaling Software Agility, Dean Leffingwell shows how to achieve a pragmatic balance among these forces. Leffingwell's observations of the problem, his advice on the solution, and his description of the resulting best practices come from experience: he's been there, done that, and has seen what's worked.” ï¾Grady Booch, IBM FellowAgile development practices, while still controversial in some circles, offer undeniable benefits: faster time to market, better responsiveness to changing customer requirements, and higher quality. However, agile practices have been defined and recommended primarily to small teams. In Scaling Software Agility, Dean Leffingwell describes how agile methods can be applied to enterprise-class development. Part I provides an overview of the most common and effective agile methods. Part II describes seven best practices of agility that natively scale to the enterprise level.

#!We present sequential ranking and selection statistical procedures that determine the best simulated model configuration among competing alternatives. The best in this context denotes the largest expected value of a given performance metric. In order to run the procedures efficiently, we give algorithms using batched observations, which under certain conditions, exhibit the characteristics necessary for the appropriate application of ranking and selection procedures. We present empirical results that indicate that the sequential procedures are quite parsimonious, in terms of the number of required observations.

#!While creative professionals spend much of their time working on illustrations, photo-editing, and laying out pages, many parts of their jobs are anything BUT creative. Too often, they spend their time doing repetitive, time-wasting tasks such as placing and replacing images, correcting errors in text, cutting and pasting, and preparing files for printing. Yet virtually every repetitive or time-consuming task that creative professionals have to do in the Adobe Creative Suite can be streamlined with the help of a script. Adobe Bridge is the new navigational center built into Adobe Creative Suite 2 software, giving users instant access to their Adobe Creative Suite project files, applications, and settings. And like all of Adobe Creative Suite 2's components, Adobe Bridge has built-in JavaScript support.Now available in print for the first time, this scripting reference provides the information experienced JavaScript users need to create scripts for Adobe Bridge, whether you're looking to create a custom file browsing view, need to export metadataï¾ from selected thumbnails automatically, or want to create custom navigational bars or dialog boxes that help streamline your company's production workflow. If you're familiar with JavaScript,, C and C++ programming, and the Adobe Creative Suite, this reference will show you how to use the scripting API to extend and manipulate Adobe Bridge.

#!Written by an experienced Active Directory designer and implementor, this book walks you through the concepts of the Active Directory, and the design issues associated with various business environments, outlining strategies, principles and best-practice for creating the design, before leading you through the implementation step-by-step. A well thought-out Active Directory provides a solid foundation for other services which will lower support costs and allow companies to centrally manage their environment. You should look at the Active Directory as your first step in moving to a centrally managed, highly integrated IT environment that supports efficient and effective delivery of business capabilities. Once the appropriate technical infrastructure is in place, it is vital to leverage that infrastructure to create an enterprise-class application infrastructure.While the basics of the Active Directory are straightforward, to get the most from it requires careful planning and a thorough understanding of what can be accomplished. For any environment there are a number of core stages in the Active Directory implementation; the 3 Ds: discovery, design, and deployment. In this unique book, we take a broad range of environment types and work through these stages; suggesting an Active Directory design specific to that environment, and how to implement it; at each stage providing clear instructions so the decisions are clearly understood and the best-practice principles will be maintained throughout your system's lifetime. There are many books on using, administering, or even deploying Active Directory, but this is the only book that exists to relate the crucial design aspects to your target environment, and show you to implement this design.This book covers discovery, design and deployment stages of Active Directory implementation in the following scenarios:· A small, single location company with fairly basic needs and a basic Windows NT 4.0 domain· A larger company with multiple regional areas which are currently facilitated by multiple NT 4.0 domains· A retail-type business with very different drivers and requirements from that of a standard business, based on Windows 2000 Active Directory· Merging and restructuring the Active Directory infrastructure of two financial institutionsThis book is for Windows network administrators, analysts, or architects, with a grasp of the basic operations of Active Directory, and are looking for a book that goes beyond rudimentary operations. However, all of the concepts are explained from the ground up, and the book can be read by network design and administration professionals with no prior Active Directory knowledge.

#*Simulating multiplexed SNP discovery rates using base-specific cleavage and mass spectrometry
#@Sebastian Böcker

#cBioinformatics
#index2479
#!Motivation: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are believed to contribute strongly to the genetic variability in living beings, and SNP and mutation discovery are of great interest in today's Life Sciences. A comparatively new method to discover such polymorphisms is based on base-specific cleavage, where resulting cleavage products are analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). One particular advantage of this method is the possibility of multiplexing the biochemical reactions, i.e. examining multiple genomic regions in parallel. Simulations can help estimating the performance of a method for polymorphism discovery, and allow us to evaluate the influence of method parameters on the discovery rate, and also to investigate whether the method is well suited for a certain genomic region. Results: We show how to efficiently conduct such simulations for polymorphism discovery using base-specific cleavage and MS. Simulating multiplexed polymorphism discovery leads us to the problem of uniformly drawing a multiplex. Given a multiset of natural numbers we want to uniformly draw a subset of fixed cardinality so that the elements sum up to some fixed total length. We show how to enumerate multiplex layouts using dynamic programming, which allows us to uniformly draw a multiplex. Contact: boecker@minet.uni-jena.de

#!In this paper we compute distances with neighbourhood sequences in the cubic and in the triangular grids. First we give a formula which computes the distance with arbitrary neighbourhood sequence in the three-dimensional digital space. After this, using the injection of the triangular grid to the cubic grid, we modify the formula for Z^3 to the triangular plane. The distances in the triangular grid have some properties which are not present on the square and cubic grids. It may be non-symmetric, and it is possible that the distance depends on the ordering of elements of the initial part of the neighbourhood sequence. The distance depends on the ordering of the initial part (up to the kth element) of the neighbourhood sequence if and only if there is a permutation of these elements such that the distance (up to value k) is non-symmetric using the elements in this new order. This dependence means somehow more flexibility of the distances based on neighbourhood sequences on the triangular grid than in Z^n.

#!In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm with silhouette statistics as discriminant function (GASS) for gene selection and pattern recognition. The proposed method evaluates gene expression patterns for discriminating heterogeneous cancers. Distance metrics and classification rules have also been analyzed to design a GASS with high classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method is compared to previously published methods. Various experimental results show that our method is effective for classifying the NCI60, the GCM and the SRBCTs datasets. Moreover, GASS outperforms other existing methods in both the leave-one-out cross validations and the independent test for novel data.

Web developers of all persuasions have embraced the Ajax suite of technologies (JavaScript, HTTP, XML and more) as a way to implement pages that are faster, livelier and more desktop-like in their behavior. Now Atlas brings the power of Ajax to ASP.NET 2.0 developers with controls, script libraries and server support that delivers engaging results without the pain that writing complex JavaScript can entail. Better yet, Atlas web pages are standards based and even run cross-browser.Programming Atlas is not just another "drag and drop" ASP.NET 2.0 book, but dives into the technologies that make it work. You'll begin with a tour of the technologies most often associated with Ajax, from JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest to JSON and the DOM. With the fundamentals in place, author JavaScript expert Christian Wenz unpacks the Atlas framework and shows you how to put its tools to work. You'll learn to:Understand the architecture of Atlas and the role played by server conrols, such as ScriptManager and UpdatePanelUse core Atlas controls and extenders to build more interactive pages with text fields that autocomplete, user input that is validated, controls that can be dragged and dropped, and much moreBind, display, and update data without causing the entire page to refresh and use the Atlas web services bridge to consume third-party services beyond the domain of your applicationIncorporate Microsoft Virtual Earth into an application, use Atlas with Web Parts, and create a Windows Live GadgetUse Atlas with PHP and explore other non-Microsoft Ajax tools for ASP.NET

#cBiological Cybernetics
#index2498
#!Recent experiments have revealed the existence of neural signatures in the activity of individual cells of the pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of crustacean. The neural signatures consist of cell-specific spike timings in the bursting activity of the neurons. The role of these intraburst neural fingerprints is still unclear. It has been reported previously that some muscles can reflect small changes in the spike timings of the neurons that innervate them. However, it is unclear to what extent neural signatures contribute to the command message that the muscles receive from the motoneurons. It is also unknown whether the signatures have any functional meaning for the neurons that belong to the same CPG or to other interconnected CPGs. In this paper, we use realistic neural models to study the ability of single cells and small circuits to recognize individual neural signatures. We show that model cells and circuits can respond distinctly to the incoming neural fingerprints in addition to the properties of the slow depolarizing waves. Our results suggest that neural signatures can be a general mechanism of spiking&#x2013;bursting cells to implement multicoding.

#!In this paper we present an effective and flexible real-time video analysis system aiming at a wide range of outdoor surveillance and monitoring scenarios, in which robust detection and tracking objects of interest (pedestrians and/or vehicles) are essential to detecting events and understanding scene changes. The approaches employed address properly the challenges found in typical outdoor scenes such as localised and global lighting changes, variations in object size and views, occlusions, and complex object motion and so on. The contributions include use of an effective two-layer shadow removal scheme based on brightness distortion in different colour channels, blob-based object tracking and occlusion handling via multi-state transition management. The system works equally well on highly compressed (JPEG+MPEG-4) video streams as well as raw video data; in the former case, it achieves about 18 frames per second with software MPEG-4 decoder in a modern PC. And the real-time constraint renders most complex tracking algorithms less attractive.

#!Signature-based network intrusion-detection systems (NIDSs) often report a massive number of simple alerts of low-level security-related events. Many of these alerts are logically involved in a single multi-stage intrusion incident and a security officer often wants to analyze the complete incident instead of each individual simple alert. This paper proposes a well-structured model that abstracts the logical relation between the alerts in order to support automatic correlation of those alerts involved in the same intrusion. The basic building block of the model is a logical formula called a capability. We use capability to abstract consistently and precisely all levels of accesses obtained by the attacker in each step of a multistage intrusion. We then derive inference rules to define logical relations between different capabilities. Based on the model and the inference rules, we have developed several novel alert correlation algorithms and implemented a prototype alert correlator. The experimental results of the correlator using several intrusion datasets demonstrate that the approach is effective in both alert fusion and alert correlation and has the ability to correlate alerts of complex multistage intrusions. In several instances, the alert correlator successfully correlated more than two thousand Snort alerts involved in massive scanning incidents. It also helped us find two multistage intrusions that were missed in auditing by the security officers.

#!Distributed systems are hard to build, profile, debug, and test. Monitoring a distributed system - to detect and analyze bugs, test for regressions, identify fault-tolerance problems or security compromises - can be difficult and error-prone. In this paper we argue that declarative development of distributed systems is well suited to tackle these tasks. We present an application logging, monitoring, and debugging facility that we have built on top of the P2 system, comprising an introspection model, an execution tracing component, and a distributed query processor. We use this facility to demonstrate a range of on-line distributed diagnosis tools that range from simple, local state assertions to sophisticated global property detectors on consistent snapshots. These tools are small, simple, and can be deployed piecemeal on-line at any point during a system's life cycle. Our evaluation suggests that the overhead of our approach to improving and monitoring running distributed systems continuously is well in tune with its benefits.

#!Certificateless cryptography involves a Key Generation Center (KGC) which issues a partial key to a user and the user also independently generates an additional public/secret key pair in such a way that the KGC who knows only the partial key but not the additional secret key is not able to do any cryptographic operation on behalf of the user; and a third party who replaces the public/secret key pair but does not know the partial key cannot do any cryptographic operation as the user either. We call this attack launched by the third party as the key replacement attack. In ACISP 2004, Yum and Lee proposed a generic construction of digital signature schemes under the framework of certificateless cryptography. In this paper, we show that their generic construction is insecure against key replacement attack. In particular, we give some concrete examples to show that the security requirements of some building blocks they specified are insufficient to support some of their security claims. We then propose a modification of their scheme and show its security in a new and simplified security model. We show that our simplified definition and adversarial model not only capture all the distinct features of certificateless signature but are also more versatile when compared with all the comparable ones. We believe that the model itself is of independent interest.A conventional certificateless signature scheme only achieves Girault's Level 2 security. For achieving Level 3 security, that a conventional signature scheme in Public Key Infrastructure does, we propose an extension to our definition of certificateless signature scheme and introduce an additional security model for this extension. We show that our generic construction satisfies Level 3 security after some appropriate and simple modification.

#!In converged mobile broadcast and cellular services, the ability to choose among hundreds of digital broadcast streams and browsing a multitude of IP based content, will necessitate integration of advanced user interfaces capable of personalized service discovery. Next generation mobile terminals should be capable of not only displaying available services in the ESG electronic service guide but dynamically filter the content according to user preferences. This article explores possibilities for personalizing service discovery by matching semantic descriptions of media according to user-centric preferences submitted through the 3G return channel. Architectural design components are identified to filter content based on XML transformation of TV-Anytime metadata and additional elements are proposed to extend the existing data models with rich semantics based on RDF syntax and OWL ontology description logics.

#!Do you spend too much time doing repetitive production tasks such as placing and replacing images, resizing them, dragging them from one document to another, and preparing images for printing instead of being creative? Do you use Adobe Photoshop CS2 and have some experience with scripting? You're in luck. Since Adobe Creative Suite 2 was created with built-in support for scripting, virtually every repetitive or time-consuming task that creative professionals have to do in the Adobe Creative Suite can be streamlined with the help of a script. This book describes how to use JavaScript to manipulate and extend Adobe Photoshop within Adobe Creative Suite 2, and provides reference information for the JavaScript objects, properties, and functions defined by Adobe's applications. Now available in print for the first time, this scripting reference provides the information experienced JavaScript users need to create custom scripts for Photoshop, whether you're looking to automate Camera Raw options and settings, automatically resize and export large batches of images into your page-layout application, or want to automatically add metadata, like a copyright notice, to selected image files. These are just a few examples of how you can use Photoshop CS2's built-in scripting capabilities to save you from hours of repetitive tasks.

#!In this article, we introduce pesudoconstraints, a novel data mining pattern aimed at identifying rare events in databases. At first, we formally define pesudoconstraints using a probabilistic model and provide a statistical test to identify pesudoconstraints in a database. Then, we focus on a specific class of pesudoconstraints, named cycle pesudoconstraints, which often occur in databases. We define cycle pesudoconstraints in the context of the ER model and present an automatic method for detecting cycle pesudoconstraints from a relational database. Finally, we present an experiment to show cycle pesudoconstraints &ldquo;at work&rdquo; on real data.

#!The pressure towards tighter or "seamless" integration of health information systems is a recurring issue with both practical and analytical relevance. It taps into a discourse in the IS literature in general and organisation and management science in particular. Unfortunately, the prevailing perception of integration in the IS literature is as a predominantly technical issue. The CSCW literature, however, is attentive to the socio-technical aspects of integration. Building on this --- but supplemented with recent elaborations in science studies --- we aim at exploring the unintended consequences of information systems integration. A user-led perspective implies emphasising the tailoring to local needs based on in-depth studies of the micro practices. We argue, however, that the condition for such an approach is radically undermined by politically motivated, regional changes towards integration with implicated standardisation. Enforcing order in the form of standards across multiple local settings, seemingly a prerequisite for tight integration, simultaneously produces disorder or additional work in other locations for other users. Empirically, our study is based on a large, ongoing integration effort at the University hospital of Northern Norway, specifically studying work practices and perceptions across multiple laboratories.

#!In the literature, on the numerical solution of nonlinear time dependent partial differential equations, much attention has been paid to numerical processes which have the favourable property of being total variation bounded (TVB). A popular approach to guaranteeing the TVB property consists in demanding that the process has the stronger property of being total variation diminishing (TVD).For Runge-Kutta methods--applied to semi-discrete approximations of partial differential equations--conditions on the time step were established which guarantee the TVD property; see, e.g., [J. Comput. Phys. 77 (1988) 439; Math. Comp. 67 (1998) 73; SIAM Rev. 43 (2001) 89; SIAM J. Numer. Anal. (2002), in press; Higueras, Tech. Report, Universidad Pública de Navarra, 2002; SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 40 (2002) 469]. These conditions were derived under the assumption that the simple explicit Euler time stepping process is TVD.However, for various important semi-discrete approximations, the Euler process is TVB but not TVD--see, e.g., [Math. Comp. 49 (1987) 105; Math. Comp. 52 (1989) 411]. Accordingly, the above stepsize conditions for Runge-Kutta methods are not directly relevant to such approximations, and there is a need for stepsize restrictions with a wider range of applications.In this paper, we propose a general theory yielding stepsize restrictions which cover a larger class of semi-discrete approximations than covered thus far in the literature. In particular, our theory gives stepsize restrictions, for general Runge-Kutta methods, which guarantee total-variation-boundedness in situations where the Euler process is TVB but not TVD.

#!In this article, we consider the problem of testing a linear hypothesis in a multivariate linear regression model which includes the case of testing the equality of mean vectors of several multivariate normal populations with common covariance matrix Σ, the so-called multivariate analysis of variance or MANOVA problem. However, we have fewer observations than the dimension of the random vectors. Two tests are proposed and their asymptotic distributions under the hypothesis as well as under the alternatives are given under some mild conditions. A theoretical comparison of these powers is made.

#!When conducting experiments, the selected quality characteristic should as far as possible be a continuous variable and be easy to measure. Due to the inherent nature of the quality characteristic or the convenience of the measurement technique and cost-effectiveness, the data observed in many experiments are ordered categorical. To analyze ordered categorical data for optimizing factor settings, there are three widely accepted approaches: Taguchi's accumulation analysis, Nair's scoring scheme and Jeng's weighted probability scoring scheme. In this paper, a simpler method named the weighted SN ratio method for analyzing ordered categorical data is introduced. A case study involving optimizing the polysilicon deposition process for minimizing surface defects and achieving the target thickness in a very large-scale integrated circuit can demonstrate the four approaches. Finally, comparative analyses of efficiency for employing the four approaches to optimize factor settings are presented according to simulated experimental data that are normally, Weibull and Gamma distributed. From the results, it is obvious that the weighted SN ratio method has the properties of easy computation and uses one-step optimization to obtain the optimal factor settings. Its efficiency is slightly less than that of the scoring scheme, better than that of the accumulation analysis and the weighted probability-scoring scheme.

We present a context for how the framework can be used through its application on two examples. In addition, we describe the design by examining the major conceptual artifacts within the object-oriented model. The framework is built on a Java Simulation Library (JSL) and permits easy modeling and execution of simulation models. The results and discussion indicate the flexibility and power of modeling with the framework. In addition, we summarize our future research efforts to model complex supply chains.

#!We look at a 1-membrane catalytic P system with evolution rules of the form Ca → Cv or a → v, where C is a catalyst, a is a noncatalyst symbol, and v is a (possibly null) string representing a multiset of noncatalyst symbols. (Note that we are only interested in the multiplicities of the symbols.) A catalytic system (CS) can be regarded as a language acceptor in the following sense. Given an input alphabet Σ consisting of noncatalyst symbols, the system starts with an initial configuration wz, where w is a fixed string of catalysts and noncatalysts not containing any symbol in z, and z = a1n1...aknk for some nonnegative integers n1,..., nk, with (a1,...,ak) ⊆ Σ. At each step, a maximal multiset of rules is nondeterministically selected and applied in parallel to the current configuration to derive the next configuration (note that the next configuration is not unique, in general). The string z is accepted if the system eventually halts.It is known that a 1-membrane CS is universal in the sense that any unary recursively enumerable language can be accepted by a 1-membrane CS (even by purely CSs, i.e., when all rules are of the form Ca → Cv). A CS is said to be deterministic if at each step there is a unique maximally parallel multiset of rules applicable. It has been an open problem whether deterministic systems of this kind are universal. We answer this question negatively. We show that the membership problem for deterministic CSs is decidable. In fact, we show that the Parikh map of the language (⊆a1*...ak*) accepted by any deterministic CS is a simple semilinear set which can be effectively constructed. Since nondeterministic 1-membrane CS acceptors (with two catalysts) are universal, our result gives the first example of a variant of P systems for which the nondeterministic version is universal, but the deterministic version is not.We also show that for a deterministic 1-membrane CS using only rules of type Ca → Cv, the set of reachable configurations from a given initial configuration is an effective semilinear set. The application of rules of type a → v, however, is sufficient to render the reachability set nonsemilinear. Our results generalize to multimembrane deterministic CSs. We also consider deterministic CSs which allow rules to be prioritized and investigate three classes of such systems, depending on how priority in the application of the rules is interpreted. For these three prioritized systems, we obtain contrasting results: two are universal and one only accepts semilinear sets.

#!“Brian Noyes' writing style easily captures your attention as he elaborates on all aspects of data binding in his book. He has a refreshingly clear and crisp delivery as he starts each chapter with a simple tour of each topic, and then leads you into practical concerns for sound practices and extensibility opportunities. Most importantly, as Brian explains approaches to data-binding architecture, patterns of usage, the value of data sets, binding controls and the rest, he always describes how he reaches his recommendations on the topic. This book is perfect for newcomers to .NET 2.0, but also for those that have some experience. Anyone who cares about data in their applications (okay, that should be almost everyone) is guaranteed to learn something new and useful by reading Brian's book.” -Michele Leroux Bustamante, IDesign chief architect, Microsoft regional director, and MVP “Brian has saved me a lot of time. I'm writing The Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual Studio and SQL Server 2005 (7th Edition) and I'm not going to have to cover data binding nearly as deeply because Brian has done it for me. His book gets right to the meat of the subject and makes data binding look easy. I was also pleased to see that the book focuses on the misunderstood and under-applied Windows Forms architecture. It's a must-read for anyone trying to make their application more interactive and to leverage the new Visual Studio 2005 technology. I'm planning to point my readers to this resource when they need an in-depth treatment of data binding.” -William Vaughn, president, Beta V Corporation “Data binding has finally come of age in Windows applications. Back in the Visual Studio 6.0 days, I ignored data binding completely and wrote my own repetitive code to encapsulate my business logic. With Visual Studio 2005, we finally have a robust and compelling data-binding technology. To ignore it today would make you inefficient and put you behind the curve. Brian delivers a clear and concise discussion of a core topic of development for Windows today. A combination of an easy-to-follow conversational yet technical tone, excellent examples, and solid explanations make this a must-read for any developer writing for Windows or learning to write for Windows.” -Stephen Forte, chief technical officer, Corzen Inc. “This book provides a clear, readable, and in-depth treatment of data binding, with detailed discussions of best practices in the presentation and use of data. Brian communicates his knowledge on the mechanics of data binding to give the low-level understanding that makes all the difference when building sophisticated applications and troubleshooting difficult problems. Effective data binding can enormously reduce the amount of code in your applications and will allow new levels of sophistication in your development. Read this book.” -Jonathan Cogley, chief executive officer, Thycotic, ASPInsider, and C# MVP “The .NET Framework 2.0, Visual Studio .NET 2005, and Windows Forms 2.0 incorporate the most powerful data-binding platform yet, and absolutely need a book like this to expose it. Brian's extensive data-binding knowledge and experience shine through as he comprehensively explores its many facets, starting with the fundamentals before tackling a wide variety of real-world scenarios. I've always thought a data-binding book was necessary, and I'm glad Brian found the time to write his.” -Michael Weinhardt, freelance author and application developer “Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0 earns a gold star and a prized place in my development book library. Brian is an exceptional teacher of technology, best practices, and technique. He continues to educate at every presentation I attend; his book carries that quality to paper. I found this book to be highly informative and full of all the important steps and examples necessary to learn this technology. In this book, Brian demonstrates a firm grasp on the concepts and I really enjoy his efforts to promote best practices at every chance. Definitively a cover-to-cover read.” -Randy Hayes, president, Expert Network Solutions, Inc. “Brian's direct and well-organized presentation makes this much misunderstood topic finally understandable.” -Sahil Malik, author of Pro ADO.NET 2.0 and C# MVPData binding is the most important part of many business applications-and one of the most difficult things to understand. Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0 is the first book to focus on this crucial area of development. It will quickly get you up to speed on binding data sources to Windows Forms components. The book contains clear examples in C# that work with SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005. Visual Basic .NET examples are available on the book's Web site.Brian Noyes, leading consultant and speaker on .NET programming, teaches you both the theory and practice of data binding and provides numerous samples ready to run in Visual Studio 2005.From his in-depth coverage, you'll learn how to Use Visual Studio 2005 to generate a data-bound application from a database Use the new Visual Studio 2005 typed data set designer, and how and why to use typed data sets and typed data adapters Perform simple and complex binding of data to controls, and how to use the .NET 2.0 BindingSource Use the Binding object for simple binding with automatic formatting, and how to handle binding events Generate bound controls with the Visual Studio Designer, and how to use Data Sources Present data with the new DataGridView control, and how to implement advanced features of the DataGridView Implement custom data-bound controls in Windows Forms Create custom business objects and collections that are suitable for use in data binding Implement validation and error handling at the Windows Forms and data-binding levels Implement data binding with ASP.NET 2.0 and the upcoming Windows Presentation Foundation (Avalon) technologies The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!The problem addressed in this paper is the template selection and update in biometrics based on clustering. Template selection is a reliable method to reduce the number of templates used in a biometric system to account for variations observed in a person's biometric data. An efficient method based on clustering with automatic selection of the number of clusters is proposed in this work for finding subgroups of similar templates which are used for prototype selection. Experimental results confirm the advantage of the new method and the importance of adopting a procedure to perform template selection.

#!The paper considers the problem of finding a spanning arborescence on a directed network whose arc costs are partially known. It is assumed that each arc cost can take on values from a known interval defining a possible economic scenario. In this context, the problem of finding the spanning arborescence which better approaches to that of minimum overall cost under each possible scenario is studied. The minimax regret criterion is proposed in order to obtain such a robust solution of the problem. As it is shown, the bounds on the optimal value of the minimax regret optimization problem obtained in a previous paper, can be used here in a Branch and Bound algorithm in order to give an optimal solution. The computational behavior of the algorithm is tested through numerical experiments.

#!This paper presents a new technique of computer-aided analysis and recognition of pathological wrist bone lesions. This method uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and mathematical linguistics allowing to evaluate automatically and analyse the structure of the said bones, based on palm radiological images. Possibilities of computer interpretation of selected images, based on the methodology of automatic medical image understanding, as introduced by the authors, were created owing to the introduction of an original relational description of individual palm (wrist) bones. This description has been built with the use of graph linguistic formalisms already applied in artificial intelligence. These were, however, developed and adjusted to the needs of automatic medical image understanding in earlier works of the authors, as specified in the bibliography section of this paper. The research described in this paper has demonstrated that the for needs of palm (wrist) bone diagnostics, specialist linguistic tools such as expansive graph grammars and EDT-label graphs are particularly well-suited. Defining a graph image language adjusted to the specific features of the scientific problem here-described allowed for a semantic description of correct palm bone structures (with consideration to idiosyncratic features). It also enabled interpretation of images showing some in-born lesions, such as additional bones; or acquired lesions such as their incorrect junctions resulting from injuries and synostoses.

#!This paper proposes a wavelet-domain multiresolution fragile watermarking scheme using an improved quantization-index-modulation (QIM) embedding technique. A secure embedding zone is exploited in our proposed scheme to reduce the false detection rate of Kundur's scheme. The frequency modulated (FM) complex chirp signal is employed as watermark. Both the real and the imaginary parts of the chirp signal are embedded simultaneously in a hierarchical manner. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme does not require the original watermark for content integrity verification and quality assessment for the distorted watermarked content. The blind authentication process allows embedding of arbitrary FM chirp watermarks.

Database in Depth: The Relational Model for Practitioners goes beyond the hype and gets to the heart of how relational databases actually work. Ideal for experienced database developers and designers, this concise guide gives you a clear view of the technology--a view that's not influenced by any vendor or product. Featuring an extensive set of exercises, it will help you: understand why and how the relational model is still directly relevant to modern database technology (and will remain so for the foreseeable future)see why and how the SQL standard is seriously deficientuse the best current theoretical knowledge in the design of their databases and database applicationsmake informed decisions in their daily database professional activities Database in Depth will appeal not only to database developers and designers, but also to a diverse field of professionals and academics, including database administrators (DBAs), information modelers, database consultants, and more. Virtually everyone who deals with relational databases should have at least a passing understanding of the fundamentals of working with relational models. Author C.J. Date has been involved with the relational model from its earliest days. An exceptionally clear-thinking writer, Date lays out principle and theory in a manner that is easily understood. Few others can speak as authoritatively the topic of relational databases as Date can.

#!Virtual Environments (VE) allow direct 3D interaction, better perception of shapes and a feel of immersion, properties that are highly desirable for design tasks. Traditional CAD software extensively use WIMP interfaces (Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointing device), but these interaction models are not suited in VE. Moreover, during a design task, the use of dialog boxes, buttons, etc. deteriorates the user's focus on his work. However, to fully benefit from immersive interaction we need more reactive behavior from 3D objects. The objects data structures must provide efficient ways for real-time modification of the geometric definitions of solids via direct 3D interactions. We will present an approach that replaces the traditional editing of the construction history graph in parametric modelers. A description of data structures and algorithms that allow the user to implicitly modify the history of a solid through a direct 3D interaction on topological elements of the objects will be given. The techniques presented here are validated in a VE prototype, using the OpenCASCADE geometric kernel and a multimodal interface.

#!All of Java's Input/Output (I/O) facilities are based on streams, which provide simple ways to read and write data of different types. Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four large categories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automatically compressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient? Java I/O, 2nd Edition has been updated for Java 5.0 APIs and tells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more.A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the Unicode standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data. Java I/O, 2nd Edition shows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software.Java I/O, 2nd Edition includes:Coverage of all I/O classes and related classesIn-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and its support for international character sets The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!Video temporal segmentation is normally the first and important step for content-based video applications. Many features including the pixel difference, colour histogram, motion, and edge information etc. have been widely used and reported in the literature to detect shot cuts inside videos. Although existing research on shot cut detection is active and extensive, it still remains a challenge to achieve accurate detection of all types of shot boundaries with one single algorithm. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic approach to integrate hybrid features for detecting shot boundaries inside general videos. The fuzzy logic approach contains two processing modes, where one is dedicated to detection of abrupt shot cuts including those short dissolved shots, and the other for detection of gradual shot cuts. These two modes are unified by a mode-selector to decide which mode the scheme should work on in order to achieve the best possible detection performances. By using the publicly available test data set from Carleton University, extensive experiments were carried out and the test results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the representative existing algorithms in terms of the precision and recall rates.

#!OBEX (Object Exchange Protocol) is a session protocol designed to exchange all kind of objects between portable devices using different ad hoc wireless links including IrDA and Bluetooth. This paper develops a mathematical model for OBEX over the IrDA protocol stack by considering multiple applications and presence of bit errors. The model is also verified by simulation results. We derive throughput equations and carry out an optimization study focusing on four major parameters: OBEX packet size, TinyTP (IrDA transport layer) buffer size, IrLAP (IrDA link layer) frame and window size. Equations are derived for the optimum IrLAP windowand frame sizes. Numerical results show significant improvement on OBEX performance using the optimized parameters. The major contribution of this work is the modelling of OBEX including the low layer protocols and optimization of the overall throughput by appropriate parameter selection.

#!Coverage includes- RD White has been DJing for nearly 10 years. He first started in 1995 with a record player, a tape deck and two stereos, matching the beat of a record with the rhythm of a store-bought mix-tape, then mixing the two by adjusting the volume knobs on two stereos. This ghetto method of mixing forced him to learn fast. By the time he could afford real turntables, mixing seemed second nature. In 1997, RD released his first official mix-tape "Skillful Means," made with two turntables, a DJ mixer and two DAT recorders. He laid the main mix down to one DAT player, then played it back through his mixer, recording to another DAT player, and layering more mixing and scratching on top. He used a similar technique in 1999 for the release of his mixï¾CD, "Watering the Timewires," although for this he used an 8-channel ADAT to record multiple layers of mixing, including his own original track mixed in using an Akai MPC-2000. Covers the newest version of this very popular DJ software product, Traktor DJ. Provides a source of good introductory information about a product that's known to have a minimal manual. Offers a pedagogy that is easy-to-follow, with step-by-step instructions and many helpful figures and callouts.

#!In this paper we study the effect of inter organizational information sharing strategies on firm level performance under both stable as well as volatile market conditions. We use information exchange in a supply chain as a representation of inter organizational information sharing, and study five strategies for information sharing that range from minimal to near-complete information exchange. We present analytical evaluation of the relative performance of these strategies and experimental results from a proof-of-concept system. Our results show that near-complete information sharing that combines more than one type of information being shared has better performance in volatile market conditions.

#!This paper describes Princeton University's approach to the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, an off-road race for fully autonomous ground vehicles. The system, Prospect Eleven, takes a simple approach to address the problems posed by the Grand Challenge, including obstacle detection, path planning, and extended operation in harsh environments. Obstacles are detected using stereo vision, and tracked in the time domain to improve accuracy in localization and reduce false positives. The navigation system processes a geometric representation of the world to identify passable regions in the terrain ahead, and the vehicle is controlled to drive through these regions. Performance of the system is evaluated both during the Grand Challenge and in subsequent desert testing. The vehicle completed 9.3 miles of the course on race day, and extensive portions of the 2004 and 2005 Grand Challenge courses in later tests. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!This paper deals with one of the most studied problems in the last few years in the field of wireless communication in ad-hoc networks. The problem consists of reducing the total energy consumption of wireless radio stations distributed over a given area of interest in order to perform the basic pattern of communication by a broadcast. Recently, a tight 6-approximation of the minimum spanning tree heuristic has been proven. While such a bound is theoretically optimal if compared to the known lower bound of 6, there is an obvious gap with practical experimental results. By extensive experiments, proposing a new technique to generate input instances and supported by theoretical results, we show how the approximation ratio can be actually considered close to 4 for a &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; set of instances. We consider, in fact, instances more representative of common practices. Those are usually composed by considerable number of nodes uniformly and randomly distributed inside the area of interest.

Standard string comparison measures perform poorly on this task due to varying transliteration conventions in both languages and the fact that Arabic script does not usually represent short vowels. Significant improvement is achieved by augmenting the classic Levenshtein edit-distance algorithm with character equivalency classes.

#!The sequence step algorithm addresses for the first time the problem of scheduling repetitive projects with probabilistic activity durations while maintaining continuous resource utilization. This algorithm is based on generalized concepts that can be implemented in most general-purpose simulation systems. The algorithm is presented in detail and is applied to an example project with 7 activities and 4 repetitive units using a simulation model developed in Stroboscope, an activity-based simulation system. Numerical and graphical results help explain the algorithm and provide insight into the underlying tradeoff problem between reducing the expected crew idle time and increasing the expected project duration.

#!Stratified Round Robin is a fair-queueing packet scheduler which has good fairness and delay properties, and low quasi-O(1) complexity. It is unique among all other schedulers of comparable complexity in that it provides a single packet delay bound that is independent of the number of flows. Importantly, it is also amenable to a simple hardware implementation, and thus fills a current gap between scheduling algorithms that have provably good performance and those that are feasible and practical to implement in high-speed routers. We present both analytical results and simulations to demonstrate its performance properties.

#!In dielectrics, glasses and networked liquids it is very common to study noise spectra with extended power-law regions to gather useful information. Experimental noise spectra are often characterized by 1/fα regions with different α and other features such as very wide resonances. Because of the overall power-law behavior these spectra are extremely difficult to fit with standard methods. Here I propose a model-based fit procedure that performs well on spectra obtained in a molecular dynamics simulation.

#!Supply chain managers today face an unremitting challenge to their capabilities in both the volume and complexity of factors to be reconciled. In order to achieve more effective decision making, it is very necessary to link strategic objectives to operational actions. However, little is available to guide managers in translating a set of objectives into operations so far. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to address this gap. In this methodology, strategic objectives are translated into performance metrics by qualitative strategy map and metric network firstly, and then quantitative techniques such as system dynamics simulation and optimization are adopted to take managers through the stages of strategy mapping, action evaluation and decision making. A case study, supported by a software tool, is carried out throughout the paper to illustrate how the method works.

#!We study the denotational semantics of an aspect calculus by compositional translation to a functional language with higher-order store and ML-style references. The calculus is designed to construct only "additive" aspects i.e. those that do not elide the execution of the base computation. Such an aspect calculus is sufficiently expressive to encode before (), after () and around () advice which calls proceed () exactly once. We prove that our translation is adequate i.e. it reflects observational equivalence. Further if a standard object-oriented view of lable is adopted, the translation is fully abstract i.e. it preserves and reflects observational equivalence. A pleasing consequence is that full abstraction of the target-language semantics is thereby inherited by the source-language semantics. This yields the first fully abstract game model for a functional language of additive aspects.

#!Abduction is the process of finding explanations for observed phenomena in accord to known laws about a given application domain. This form of reasoning is an important principle of common-sense reasoning and is particularly relevant in conjunction with nonmonotonic knowledge representation formalisms. In this paper, we deal with a model for abduction in which the domain knowledge is represented in terms of a default theory. We show how the main reasoning tasks associated with this particular form of abduction can be axiomatised within the language of quantified Boolean logic. More specifically, we provide polynomial-time constructible reductions mapping a given abduction problem into a quantified Boolean formula (QBF) such that the satisfying truth assignments to the free variables of the latter determine the solutions of the original problem. Since there are now efficient QBF-solvers available, this reduction technique yields a straightforward method to implement the discussed abduction tasks. We describe a realisation of this approach by appeal to the reasoning system QUIP.

#!Optimal performance in two-alternative, free response decision-making tasks can be achieved by the drift-diffusion model of decision making - which can be implemented in a neural network - as long as the threshold parameter of that model can be adapted to different task conditions. Evidence exists that people seek to maximize reward in such tasks by modulating response thresholds. However, few models have been proposed for threshold adaptation, and none have been implemented using neurally plausible mechanisms. Here we propose a neural network that adapts thresholds in order to maximize reward rate. The model makes predictions regarding optimal performance and provides a benchmark against which actual performance can be compared, as well as testable predictions about the way in which reward rate may be encoded by neural mechanisms.

#!Abstract real-time cloth simulation involves the solution of many computational challenges, particularly in the context of haptic applications, where high frame rates are necessary for obtaining a satisfactory tactile experience. In this paper, we present a real-time cloth simulation system that offers a compromise between a realistic physically-based simulation of fabrics and a haptic application with high requirements in terms of computation speed. We place emphasis on architecture and algorithmic choices for obtaining the best compromise in the context of haptic applications. A first implementation using a haptic device demonstrates the features of the proposed system and leads to the development of new approaches for haptic rendering using the proposed approach.

#!We consider a single machine scheduling problem in which the processing time of a job is a simple linear increasing function of its starting time and the machine is subject to an availability constraint. We consider the non-resumable case. The objectives are to minimize the makespan and the total completion time. We show that both problems are NP-hard and present pseudopolynomial time optimal algorithms to solve them. Furthermore, for the makespan problem, we present an optimal approximation algorithm for the on-line case, and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the off-line case. For the total completion time problem, we provide a heuristic and evaluate its efficiency by computational experiments.

#!Sketch-drawings is an intuitive and comprehensive means of conveying movement ideas in character animation. We proposed a novel sketch-based approach to assisting the authoring and choreographing of Kungfu motions at the early stage of animation creation. Given two human figure sketches corresponding to the initial and closing posture of a Kungfu form, and the trajectory drawings on specific moving joints, MotionMaster can directly rapid-prototype the realistic 3D motion sequence by sketch-based motion retrieval and refinement based on a motion database. The animators can then preview and evaluate the recovered motion sequence from any viewing angles. After the 3D motion sequence has been associated with the 2D sketch drawing, the animator can also interactively and iteratively make changes on the 2D sketch drawing, and the system will automatically transfer the 2D changes to the 3D motion data of current interests. It greatly helps the animator focus on the movement idea development during the evolutionary process of building motion data for articulated characters.

Our computational experience, however, leads us to believe that the method is too costly even for this modest objective.

#!Adjusted Rand index is used to measure diversity in cluster ensembles and a diversity measure is subsequently proposed. Although the measure was found to be related to the quality of the ensemble, this relationship appeared to be non-monotonic. In some cases, ensembles which exhibited a moderate level of diversity gave a more accurate clustering. Based on this, a procedure for building a cluster ensemble of a chosen type is proposed (assuming that an ensemble relies on one or more random parameters): generate a small random population of cluster ensembles, calculate the diversity of each ensemble and select the ensemble corresponding to the median diversity. We demonstrate the advantages of both our measure and procedure on 5 data sets and carry out statistical comparisons involving two diversity measures for cluster ensembles from the recent literature. An experiment with 9 data sets was also carried out to examine how the diversity-based selection procedure fares on ensembles of various sizes. For these experiments the classification accuracy was used as the performance criterion. The results suggest that selection by median diversity is no worse and in some cases is better than building and holding on to one ensemble.

#!A new notion of participation is at stake with advances in technologically mediated work environments. Insufficient bandwidth and insufficiently powerful, crudely coordinated tools resulted in distributed task-based modes of collaboration that did not allow full participation by members of distributed design teams. The emergence of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and User-Controlled Light-Paths (UCLP) herald the beginning of a new age where fully participatory multi-site design may become possible.While most service-oriented solutions are developed for gluing systems or data together, the Participatory Design Studio (PDS) Eucalyptus is developed to manage and configure the resources needed by users engaging in a participatory design session, such as a videoconference application, and a visualization server. Harnessing the power of UCLP, Eucalyptus strives to provide a set of upper layer services for non-technical users to provision devices and applications running on high-speed broadband networks, in addition to conventional TCP/IP networks.

#!System on a chip design results in the integration of digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuits on the same substrate which further complicates the already difficult validation problem. This paper presents a new model, labeled hybrid Petri nets (LHPNs), that is developed to be capable of modeling such a heterogeneous set of components. This paper also describes a compiler from VHDL-AMS to LHPNs. To support formal verification, this paper presents an efficient zone-based state space exploration algorithm for LHPNs. This algorithm uses a process known as warping to allow zones to describe continuous variables that may be changing at variable rates. Finally, this paper describes the application of this algorithm to a couple of analog/mixed-signal circuit examples.

#@Ping Yu,Stephen R. Tate

#cProceedings of the 21st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops - Volume 01
#index2840
#!We propose an efficient digital signature scheme, which is proved secure under the strong RSA assumption, and can operate in an online/offline manner, doing most of its work in the offline precomputation phase. The online phase, which is performed after the message to be signed is known, is very efficient, requiring only a single modular multiplication. Online/offline signatures are useful in settings in which signatures need to be produced quickly either when there is a large volume of requests or if the device performing the signature is not computationally powerful (such as a mobile device). Our scheme can be seen as an online/offline extension of the traditional signature scheme of Gennaro, Halevi, and Rabin (the GHR signature scheme) which did not operate in this two-phase manner, and required significant computation after the message was known. In contrast to another online/offline extension of the GHR scheme, our new scheme avoids the use of trapdoor hash/commitment primitives, allowing the use of a traditional hash function, improving the efficiency of the offline phase of the algorithm.

#!Considering the analogy between image segmentation and cluster analysis, the aim of this paper is to adapt statistical texture measures to describe the spatial distribution of multidimensional observations. The main idea is to consider the cluster cores as domains characterized by their specific textures in the data space. The distribution of the data points is first described as a multidimensional histogram defined on a multidimensional regular array of sampling points. In order to evaluate locally a multidimensional texture, a co-occurrence matrix is introduced, which characterizes the local distribution of the data points in the multidimensional data space. Several local texture features can be computed from this co-occurrence matrix, which accumulates spatial and statistical information on the data distribution in the neighborhoods of the sampling points. Texture features are selected according to their ability to discriminate different distributions of data points. The sampling points where the local underlying texture is evaluated are categorized into different texture classes. The points assigned to these classes tend to form connected components in the data space, which are considered as the cores of the clusters.

#!This paper presents the design and implementation of a hip range of motion (ROM) estimation method that is capable of fine-grained estimation during total hip replacement (THR) surgery. Our method is based on two acceleration strategies: (1) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for complexity reduction and (2) parallelization for further acceleration. On the assumption that the hip ROM is a single closed region, the AMR strategy reduces the complexity for N × N × N stance configurations from O(N3) to O(ND), where 2 ≤ D ≤ 3 and D is a data-dependent value that can be approximated by 2 in most cases. The parallelization strategy employs the master-worker paradigm with multiple task queues, reducing synchronization between processors with load balancing. The experimental results indicate that the implementation on a cluster of 64 PCs completes estimation of 360 × 360 × 180 stance configurations in 20 seconds, playing a key role in selecting and aligning the optimal combination of artificial joint components during THR surgery.

#!In parallel computing structures, Hypercubes [P. J. Wan, L. W. Liu, Y. Yang, Optimal routing based on the super-topology in Hypercube WDM networks, 1999, pp. 142-149] and [Y. R. Leu, S. Y. Kuo, A fault-tolerant tree communication scheme for hypercube systems, IEEE Trans Comput. 45(6) (1996) 643-650] have many advantages: they support parallel computing, provide disjoint paths, and tolerate faults. If devices with computing capabilities can be linked as a Hypercube by taking advantage of Bluetooth radio's features, then an efficient communication and high-performance computing environment can be established by applying currently used algorithms. A Bluetooth device randomly searches for and connects with other devices, using time-consuming inquiry/inquiry scan and page/page scan operation and hence, results in an uncontrolled scatternet topology and inefficient communications. The present work proposes a three-stage distributed construction protocol for rapidly organizing a Hypercube computing environment that was constructed from Bluetooth devices. The proposed protocol governs the construction of links, the assigning of roles and the formation of the scatternet in order to efficiently construct a Hypercube structure. The constructed scatternet easily enables Bluetooth devices to establish a routing path, tolerate faults and create disjoint paths, and thus, achieves parallel and distributed computing in a Bluetooth wireless environment. Experimental results reveal that the proposed protocol can set up a scatternet that is appropriate for parallel computing and communications.

#!In this paper, we introduce a new technique for the design of high-performance Rayleigh fading channel simulators. The proposed design method uses set partitioning --- a technique, which plays a key role in the design of trellis-coded modulation schemes. We show how set partitioning can be used to design multiple uncorrelated fading waveforms enabling the simulation of Rayleigh fading channels. For the important case of isotropic scattering, we show that the sample average of the generated waveforms results in a deterministic process, the autocorrelation function (ACF) of which tends to the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind as the number of sample functions increases. The proposed procedure is completely deterministic. The comparison with a stochastic procedure using Monte Carlo techniques will be made. A study of the performance shows clearly that the new technique using set partitioning outperforms by far existing Monte Carlo methods.

#!There are two commonly accepted paradigms for organizing intelligence in robotic vehicles, namely, reactive and deliberative. Although these paradigms are well known to researchers, there are few published examples directly comparing their development and application on similar vehicles operating in similar environments. Virginia Tech's participation, with two nearly identical vehicles in the DARPA Grand Challenge, afforded a practical opportunity for such a case study. The two Virginia Tech vehicles, Cliff and Rocky, proved capable of off-road navigation, including road following and obstacle avoidance in complex desert terrain. Under the conditions of our testing, the reactive paradigm developed for Cliff produced smoother paths and proved to be more reliable than the deliberative paradigm developed for Rocky. The deliberative method shows great promise for planning feasible paths through complex environments, but it proved unnecessarily complex for the desert road navigation problem posed by the Grand Challenge. This case study, while limited to two specific software implementations, may help to shed additional light on the tradeoffs and performance of competing approaches to machine intelligence. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!A real-time terrain mapping and estimation algorithm using Gaussian sum elevation densities to model terrain variations in a planar gridded elevation model is presented. A formal probabilistic analysis of each individual sensor measurement allows the modeling of multiple sources of error in a rigorous manner. Measurements are associated to multiple locations in the elevation model using a Gaussian sum conditional density to account for uncertainty in measured elevation as well as uncertainty in the in-plane location of the measurement. The approach is constructed such that terrain estimates and estimation error statistics can be constructed in real-time without maintaining a history of sensor measurements. The algorithm is validated experimentally on the 2005 Cornell University DARPA Grand Challenge ground vehicle, demonstrating accurate and computationally feasible elevation estimates on dense terrain models, as well as estimates of the errors in the terrain model. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!We describe a mixed-initiative framework designed to support the customization of complex graphical user interfaces. The framework uses an innovative form of online GOMS analysis to provide the user with tailored customization suggestions aimed at maximizing the user's performance with the interface. The suggestions are presented non-intrusively, minimizing disruption and allowing the user to maintain full control. The framework has been applied to a general user-productivity application. A formal user evaluation of the system provides encouraging evidence that this mixed-initiative approach is preferred to a purely adaptable alternative and that the system's suggestions help improve task performance.

#!We present a method for articulating and posing meshes, in particular facial meshes, through a 2D sketching interface. Our method establishes an interface between 3D meshes and 2D sketching with the inference of reference and target curves. Reference curves allow for user selection of features on a mesh and their manipulation to match a target curve. Our articulation system uses these curves to specify the deformations of a character rig, forming a coordinate space of mesh poses. Given such a coordinate space, our posing system uses reference and target curves to find the optimal pose of the mesh with respect to the sketch input. We present results demonstrating the efficacy of our method for mesh articulation, mesh posing with articulations generated in both Maya and our sketch-based system, and mesh animation using human features from video. Through our method, we aim to both provide novice-accessible articulation and posing mesh interfaces and rapid prototyping of complex deformations for more experienced users.

#!The sophistication and complexity of analysis performed by today's network intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) benefits greatly from implementation using general-purpose CPUs. Yet the performance of such CPUs increasingly lags behind that necessary to process today's high-rate traffic streams. A key observation, however, is that much of the traffic comprising a high-volume stream can, after some initial analysis, be qualified as "likely uninteresting." To this end, we have developed an in-line, FPGA-based IPS ac-celerator, the Shunt, using the NetFPGA2 platform. The Shunt functions as the forwarding device used by the IPS; it alone processes the bulk of the traffic, offloading the memory bus and leaving the CPU free to inspect the subset of the traffic deemed germane for security analysis. To do so, the Shunt maintains several large state tables indexed by packet header fields, including IP/TCP flags, source and destination IP addresses, and connection tuples. The tables yield decision values the element makes on a packet-by-packet basis: forward the packet, drop it, or divert it through the IPS. By manipulating table entries, the IPS can specify the traffic it wishes to examine, directly block malicious traffic, and "cut through" traffic streams once it has had an opportunity to "vet" them, all on a fine-grained basis. We base our design on a novel series of caches, with a "fail safe" miss policy, coupled to a host PC to handle both cache management and higher level IPS analysis. The design requires only 2 MB of SRAM for its extensive caches, and can sup-port four Gbps Ethernets on a single Virtex 2 Pro 30.

#%478965
#!We present subroutines for the Cholesky factorization of a positive-definite symmetric matrix and for solving corresponding sets of linear equations. They exploit cache memory by using the block hybrid format proposed by the authors in a companion article. The matrix is packed into n(n &plus; 1)/2 real variables, and the speed is usually better than that of the LAPACK algorithm that uses full storage (n2 variables). Included are subroutines for rearranging a matrix whose upper or lower-triangular part is packed by columns to this format and for the inverse rearrangement. Also included is a kernel subroutine that is used for the Cholesky factorization of the diagonal blocks since it is suitable for any positive-definite symmetric matrix that is small enough to be held in cache. We provide a comprehensive test program and simple example programs.

#@D. Steiner,A. Fischer

#%251904

#!Parameterization of 3D meshes is important for many graphics and CAD applications, in particular for texture mapping, re-meshing and morphing. Current parameterization methods for closed manifold genus-n meshes usually involve cutting the mesh according to the object generators, fixing the resulting boundary and then applying the 2D position for each of the mesh vertices on a plane, such that the flattened triangles are not too distorted and do not overlap. Unfortunately, fixing the boundary distorts the resulting parameterization, especially near the boundary. A special case is that of closed manifold genus-1 meshes that have two generators. They can therefore be flattened naturally to a plane without the use of a fixed boundary while still maintaining the continuity of the parameterization. Therefore, in treating genus-1 objects, this attribute must be exploited. This paper introduces a generalized method for planar parameterization of closed manifold genus-1 meshes. As in any planar parameterization with a fixed boundary, weights are assigned over the mesh edges. The type of weights defined depends on the type of mesh characteristics to be preserved. The paper proves that the method satisfies the non-overlapping requirement for any type of positive barycentric weights, including nonsymmetrical weights. Moreover, convergence is guaranteed according to the Gauss-Seidel method. The proposed method is simple to implement, fast and robust. The feasibility of the method will be demonstrated on several complex objects.

#!Simulation and experimentation are two complementary techniques for performance evaluation, each one of them having opposite characteristics and advantages. While one allows total control and abstraction in the experiment, the other provides greater detail and realism. Though ideally it would be desirable to perform both, it is hard to direct the required efforts to develop a performance evaluation twice, once over a simulator and then again on a real network. In this paper a new approach is explored through a tool called Simmcast Testbed, which allows one to execute, from a single codebase, experiments both in simulation and experimentation mode. A didactic example is discussed in detail, and the correlation of the simulated and experimental results is presented.

#!Many industrial verification teams are developing suitable event-sequence languages for hardware verification. Such languages must be expressive, designer friendly, and hardware specific, as well as efficient to verify. While the formal verification community has formal models for assessing the efficiency of an event-sequence language, none of these models also accounts for designer friendliness. We propose an intermediate language for event sequences that addresses both concerns. The language achieves usability through a correlation to timing diagrams; its efficiency arises from its mapping into deterministic weak automata. We present the language, relate it to existing event-sequence languages, and prove its relationship to deterministic weak automata. These results indicate that timing diagrams can become more expressive while remaining more efficient for symbolic model checking than LTL.

#!Previous work has shown that the Cornish-Fisher expansion (CFE) can be used successfully in conjunction with discrete event simulation models of manufacturing systems to estimate cycle-time quantiles. However, the accuracy of the approach degrades when non-FIFO dispatching rules are employed for at least one workstation. This paper suggests a modification to the CFE-only approach which utilizes a power data transformation in conjunction with the CFE. An overview of the suggested approach is given, and results of the implemented approach are presented for a model of a non-volatile memory factory. Cycle-time quantiles for this system are estimated using the CFE with and without the data transformation, and results show a significant accuracy improvement in cycle-time quantile estimation when the transformation is used. Additionally, the technique is shown to be easy to implement, to require very low data storage, and to allow easy estimation of the entire cycle-time cumulative distribution function.

#!During its almost forty years of existence, facial animation has seen a host of technologies being invented, then fading into obsolescence. The modelling and animation methods have mostly been dictated by the available hardware, which greatly evolved through the years. Many animation desiderata that have been considered dreams at the time are now reality while ever new frontiers are encountered and explored. This paper provides an overview of the historically used technologies and attempts to predict the future trends in the field of facial animation as it permeates the entertainment industry with its feature films and computer games; the broad field of visualisation in science, including medical science and forensic analysis; and the fast growing field of information and communication technology and human-computer interaction.

#@Gordon B. Hatfield
#t1975
#cIssue 19 (August 1975)
#index2981
#!Linear programming (LP) is an area of applied mathematics that is concerned with the minimization (or maximization) of a real-valued linear function on a convex polyhedron. Since the underlying theory is relatively straightforward, the history of the field is dated by the development of algorithms for solving LP problems. Thus the first important contribution was the simplex method developed in 1974 by George Dantzig (4, p. 15). The approach taken by Dantzig was to transform the inequality constraints into a system of equations with sign-restricted variables. This permitted pivoting methods, for solving systems of equations, to be used in linear programming. Thus the simplex method is a set of pivoting rules designed to maximize a linear function constrained by a set of linear equations. Geometrically it can be viewed as an adjacent extreme point method that finds the maximum through an iterative process of implicitly enumerating basic feasible solutions.

#!In this article, we present logical coordinates based routing (LCR), a novel framework for scalable and location-independent routing in wireless sensor networks. LCR assigns each node a logical coordinate vector, and routes packets following these vectors. We demonstrate that LCR (i) guarantees packet delivery with a high probability, (ii) finds good paths, and (iii) exhibits robust performance in the presence of network voids and node failures. We systematically evaluate the performance of LCR through simulations and compare it with other state-of-the-art protocols. We also propose two extensions of LCR, one for three-dimensional node deployments and the other for unreliable wireless links.

#!This paper presents an implicit curve and surface design technique that uses smooth unit step functions. With the proposed method, an implicit curve or surface can be generated by inputting a sequence of points together with the normals at these points of the curve or surface to be designed. By choosing appropriate smooth unit step functions, these curves and surfaces can be designed to any required degree of smoothness.

#*Assigning data to dual memory banks in DSPs with a genetic algorithm using a repair heuristic
#@G. Gréwal,S. Coros,D. Banerji,A. Morton
#t2007
#cApplied Intelligence
#index3013
#!To increase memory bandwidth, many programmable Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) employ two on-chip data memories. This architectural feature supports higher memory bandwidth by allowing multiple data memory accesses to occur in parallel. Exploiting dual memory banks, however, is a challenging problem for compilers. This, in part, is due to the instruction-level parallelism, small numbers of registers, and highly specialized register capabilities of most DSPs. In this paper, we present a new methodology based on a genetic algorithm for assigning data to dual-bank memories. Our approach is global, and integrates several important issues in memory assignment within a single model. Special effort is made to identify those data objects that could potentially benefit from an assignment to a specific memory, or perhaps duplication in both memories. As part of our experimentation, we compare the effectiveness of three different repair heuristics which consist in transforming infeasible solutions into feasible ones. Our computational results show that when using the most effective repair method, the GA is able to achieve a 54% reduction in the number of memory cycles and a reduction in the range of 7 to 42% in the total number of cycles when tested with well-known DSP kernels and applications.

#!Authentication and key exchange are fundamental for establishing secure communication channels over public insecure networks. Password-based protocols for authenticated key exchange are designed to work even when user authentication is done via the use of passwords drawn from a small known set of values. Recently, Wen et al. (H.-A. Wen, T.-F. Lee, T. Hwang, Provably secure three-party password-based authenticated key exchange protocol using Weil pairing, IEE Proceedings-Communications 152 (2) (2005) 138-143) proposed a new protocol for password-based authenticated key exchange in the three-party setting, where the clients trying to establish a common secret key do not share a password between themselves but only with a trusted server. Wen et al.'s protocol carries a claimed proof of security in a formal model of communication and adversarial capabilities. However, this work shows that the protocol for three-party key exchange is completely insecure and the claim of provable security is seriously incorrect. We conduct a detailed analysis of flaws in the protocol and its security proof, in the hope that no similar mistakes are made in the future.

#!This paper is about the flexible composition of efficient simulation models. It presents the realization of a component framework that can be added as an additional layer on top of simulation systems. It builds upon platform independent specifications of components in XML to evaluate dependency relationships and parameters during composition. The process of composition is split up into four stages. Starting from XML documents component instances are created. These can be customized and arranged to form a composition. Finally, a composition is transformed to an executable simulation model. The first three stages are general applicable to simulation systems; the last one depends on the Parallel DEVS formalism and the simulation system James II.

#!It is well known that the applicability of independent component analysis (ICA) to high-dimensional pattern recognition tasks such as face recognition often suffers from two problems. One is the small sample size problem. The other is the choice of basis functions (or independent components). Both problems make ICA classifier unstable and biased. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ICA algorithm by ensemble learning approach, named as random independent subspace (RIS), to deal with the two problems. Firstly, we use the random resampling technique to generate some low dimensional feature subspaces, and one classifier is constructed in each feature subspace. Then these classifiers are combined into an ensemble classifier using a final decision rule. Extensive experimentations performed on the FERET database suggest that the proposed method can improve the performance of ICA classifier.

For this purpose we define a sequence of new algorithms whose error/cost properties improve from step to step. These algorithms yield new upper complexity bounds, which differ from known lower bounds by only an arbitrarily small positive parameter in the exponent, and a logarithmic factor. In both the randomized and quantum settings, initial-value problems turn out to be essentially as difficult as scalar integration.

#!Object-oriented operating systems prefer to consider every data structure as an object. However, data structures predefined by the hardware's manufacturer do not fit into this scheme. First of all, traditional object-oriented languages do not support objects with user-defined representation, which would be needed to these data structures as objects. Secondly, classic object-oriented languages have an overhead unacceptable for operating systems. To overcome both problems we introduce predicate classes into C as an extension of the standard structures. Inheritance is based on overlapping reserved fields without extending the object in size, which enables polymorphism by value, a very important feature in system programming. Dispatcher routines of methods add no significant overhead compared to standard C.

#!SimPy is a Python-based, interpreted simulation tool that offers the power and convenience of Python. It is able to launch processes and sub-processes using generators, which act autonomously and may interact using interrupts. SimPy offers other advantages over competing commercial codes in that it allows for modular development, use of a version control system such as CVS, can be made self-documenting with PyDoc, and is completely extensible. The convenience of an interpreted language, however, is offset for large models by slower than desired run times. This disadvantage can be compensated for by parallelizing the system using PyMPI, from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

#!We propose an operational model that combines message meaning and conversational structure in one comprehensive approach. Our long-term research goal is to lay down principles uniting message meaning and conversational structure while providing an operational foundation that could be implemented in open computer systems. In this paper we explore our advances in one aspect of meaning that in theories of language use is known as "signal meaning", and propose a layered model in which the meaning of messages can be defined according to their fitness to advance the state of joint activities. Messages in our model are defined in terms of social commitments, which have been shown to entice conversational structure.

#!In order to improve the retrieval accuracy of content-based image retrieval systems, research focus has been shifted from designing sophisticated low-level feature extraction algorithms to reducing the 'semantic gap' between the visual features and the richness of human semantics. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive survey of the recent technical achievements in high-level semantic-based image retrieval. Major recent publications are included in this survey covering different aspects of the research in this area, including low-level image feature extraction, similarity measurement, and deriving high-level semantic features. We identify five major categories of the state-of-the-art techniques in narrowing down the 'semantic gap': (1) using object ontology to define high-level concepts; (2) using machine learning methods to associate low-level features with query concepts; (3) using relevance feedback to learn users' intention; (4) generating semantic template to support high-level image retrieval; (5) fusing the evidences from HTML text and the visual content of images for WWW image retrieval. In addition, some other related issues such as image test bed and retrieval performance evaluation are also discussed. Finally, based on existing technology and the demand from real-world applications, a few promising future research directions are suggested.

#!This paper explores how the dynamics of complex biological processes can be modelled and simulated as an organisation of multiple agents. This modelling perspective identifies organisational structure occurring in complex decentralised processes and handles complexity of the analysis of the dynamics by structuring these dynamics according to an organisational structure. More specifically, dynamic properties at different levels of aggregation in the organisational structure are identified, and related to each other according to the organisational structure. The applicability of this organisational modelling approach to address complexity in biological context is illustrated by a case study: the organisation of intracellular processes.

#index3086
#!A method for evaluating image segmentation methods is proposed in this paper. The method is based on a perception model where the drawing act is used to represent visual mental percepts. Each segmented image is represented by a minimal set of features and the segmentation method is tested against a set of sketches that represent a subset of the original image database, using the Mahalanobis distance function. The covariance matrix is set using a collection of sketches drawn by different users. The different drawings are demonstrated to be consistent across users. This evaluation method can be used to solve the problem of parameter selection in image segmentation, as well as to show the goodness or limitations of the different segmentation algorithms. Different well-known color segmentation algorithms are analyzed with the proposed method and the nature of each one is discussed. This evaluation method is also compared with heuristic functions that serve for the same purpose, showing the importance of using users' pictorial knowledge.

The system attempts to simulate the human precedence given to particular financial statistics by using an interchangeable priority system and fuzzy membership scaling. The system receives financial statistics from multiple aspects of a company's characteristics and makes generalised decisions based on the objectives set out by the focal organisation. The hierarchical structure and the membership scaling of the system are directly linked to the focal organisation's profile and their acquisition objectives.

#!LIGA is the basic idea of promising developments for the manufacturing of microelectromechanical system parts containing high aspect ratio microstructures. Aim of the work is a brief discussion of the starting-points for inline process inspection within a direct LIGA technology using deep X-ray lithography for the production of micromechanical gear wheels with critical dimensions of &#x223c;35&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m width at &#x223c;1&#x00a0;mm height as well as to show methodic and technical measuring possibilities. Firstly, results of the determination of residual solvent content distribution within ultra-thick SU-8 films are shown obtained from refracted near field optical measurements. Furthermore, the capability of X-ray computer tomographic imaging is discussed and measurements for the determination of the three-dimensional shape of high aspect ratio microstructures are practically demonstrated with microscopic and interferometric optical methods. Finally, first results demonstrate the potential of the optical coherence tomography for several further important measurement tasks, among others, e.g. for the imaging of the distribution of mechanical stress at the resist&#x2013;substrate interface. The results show that much information which is essential in the LIGA process can be achieved with recently available measurement methods. However, further development of non-destructive measurement techniques would be desirable for an effective inline process control of mass production of micromechanical parts.

#!Wrinkles and folds play an important role in the appearance of real textiles. The way in which they form depends mainly on the bending properties of the specific material type. Existing approaches fail to reliably reproduce characteristic behaviour like folding and buckling for different material types or resolutions. It is therefore crucial for the realistic simulation of cloth to model bending energy in a physically accurate and consistent way. In this paper we present a new method based on a corotational formulation of subdivision finite elements. Due to the non-local nature of the employed subdivision basis functions a C1-continuous displacement field can be defined. In this way, it is possible to use the governing equations of thin shell analysis leading to physically accurate bending behaviour. Using a corotated strain tensor allows the large displacement analysis of cloth while retaining a linear system of equations. Hence, known convergence properties and computational efficiency are preserved while convincing and detailed folding behaviour is obtained in the simualtion.

#!An experimental investigation on the heat transfer effectiveness of solid and slit ribs mounted on the bottom surface of a rectangular channel has been carried out at Reynolds numbers of 13400, 22600, 32100 and 40800. The rib height to hydraulic diameter ratio (e/D_h) set during experiment is equal to 0.0624. The surface Nusselt number results from transient liquid crystal thermography are presented. The heat transfer enhancement performance analysis has been carried out using entropy generation principle. The slit rib is superior to solid rib from both heat transfer augmentation and pressure penalty point of view. The performance of the slit rib is a function of the open area ratio (&beta;) and the location of the slit (b) from the bottom test surface. The optimum open area ratio is 20% and the slit located symmetrically from the top and bottom surface of the rib is the optimum location of the slit. The heat transfer augmentation of the slit rib (&beta; = 20%) is 61% in comparison to 40% for the solid rib at Re = 32100 and the pressure penalty for the slit rib is 7% lower than the solid rib. The entropy generation for the slit rib is 33% less than that of the solid rib.

#!We use jackknife-based estimators to reduce bias when estimating the optimal value of a stochastic program. Our discussion focuses on an asset allocation model with a power utility function. As we will describe, estimating the optimal value of such a problem plays a key role in establishing the quality of a candidate solution, and reducing bias improves our ability to do so efficiently. We develop a jackknife estimator that is adaptive in that it does not assume the order of the bias is known a priori.

#!Superposition of radial basis functions centered at given prototype patterns constitutes one of the most suitable energy forms for gradient systems that perform nearest neighbor classification with real-valued static prototypes. It is shown in this paper that a continuous-time dynamical neural network model, employing a radial basis function and a sigmoid multi-layer perceptron sub-networks, is capable of maximizing such an energy form locally, thus performing almost perfectly nearest neighbor classification, when initiated by a distorted pattern. The proposed design scheme allows for explicit representation of prototype patterns as network parameters, as well as augmenting additional or forgetting existing memory patterns. The dynamical classification scheme implemented by the network eliminates all comparisons, which are the vital steps of the conventional nearest neighbor classification process. The performance of the proposed network model is demonstrated on binary and gray-scale image reconstruction applications.

#!Wireless devices now hold multiple radio interfaces, allowing to switch from one network to another according to required connectivity and related quality. Still, the selection of the best radio interface for a specific connection is under the responsibility of the end-user in most cases. Integrated multi-radio network management so as to improve the overall performance of the network(s) up to the software application layer, has led to a number of research efforts over the last few years. However, several challenges remain due to the inherent complexity of the problem. This paper specifically concentrates on the comprehensive analysis of energy-efficient multi-radio networking for pervasive computing. Building upon the service oriented architectural style, we consider pervasive networks of software services, which are deployed on the various networked nodes. The issue is then to optimize the energetic performance of the pervasive network through careful selection of the radio link over which service access should be realized for each such access. By considering the most common wireless interfaces in use today (Bluetooth, WiFi and GPRS), we introduce a formal model of service-oriented multi-radio networks. The proposed model enables characterizing the optimal network configuration in terms of energetic performance, which is shown to be a NP-hard problem and thus requires adequate approximation.

#!Many object recognition or identification applications involve comparing features associated with point-sets. This paper presents an affine invariant point-set matching technique which measures the similarity between two point-sets by embedding them into an affine invariant feature space. The developed technique assumes no a priori knowledge of reference points, as is the case in many identification problems. Reference points of a point-set are obtained based on its convex hull. An enhanced version of the Modified Hausdorff Distance is also introduced and used in the feature space for comparing two point-sets. It should be noted that the technique does not attempt to obtain correspondences between the point-sets. The introduced technique is applied to two real databases and its performance is found favorable as compared to three other affine invariant matching techniques.

#!Programs are increasingly organized around features, which are encapsulated using aspects and other linguistic mechanisms. Despite their growing popularity amongst developers, there is a dearth of techniques for computer-aided verification of programs that employ these mechanisms. We present the theoretical underpinnings for applying model checking to programs (expressed as state machines) written using these mechanisms. The analysis is incremental, examining only components that change rather than verifying the entire system every time one part of it changes. Our technique assumes that the set of pointcut designators is known statically, but the actual advice can vary. It handles both static and dynamic pointcut designators. We present the algorithm, prove it sound, and address several subtleties that arise, including cascading advice application and problems of circular reasoning.

#!Error minimization of global functionals provides a natural setting for analyzing image processing and regularization. This approach leads to scale spaces, which in the continuous formulation are the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work we derive properties for a class of inverse scale space methods. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a proof that the methods considered are convergent for convex regularization operators. The proof is based on energy methods and the Bregman distance. Further, estimates for convergence toward a clean image with noisy forcing data is provided in terms of both the L 2 norm and Bregman distances. This leads to natural estimates of optimal stopping scale for the inverse scale space method. These analytical results are discussed in the context of a numerical example.

#!Nearly every well installation process nowadays relies on some sort of risk assessment study, given the high costs involved. Those studies focus mostly on estimating the total time required by the well drilling and completion operations, as a way to predict the final costs. Among the different techniques employed, the Monte Carlo simulation currently stands out as the preferred method. One relevant aspect which is frequently left out from simulation models is the dependence relationship among the processes under consideration. That omission can have a serious impact on the results of risk assessment and, consequently, on the conclusions drawn from them. In general, practitioners do not incorporate the dependence information because that is not always an easy task. This paper intends to show how Copula functions may be used as a tool to build correlation-aware Monte Carlo simulation models.

#!If you're ready for an Elements 3 book that breaks all the rules, this is it, because it does something for digital photographers that's never been done before--it cuts through the bull and shows you exactly "how to do it." It tells you, flat-out, which settings to use, when to use them, and why.This book is not a bunch of theory; it doesn't challenge you to come up with your own settings or figure things out on your own. It gives you the same settings used by some of the top digital pros, settings you can use today to get professional results you've always dreamed of.Plus, since this book is designed for photographers, it doesn't waste your time talking about how to frame a shot, setting your exposure, etc. and there's no talk which camera or printer to buy. It's all Elements, step-by-step, cover-to-cover in the only book of its kind, and you're gonna love it!Besides learning the inside tips and the tricks of the trade for correcting, editing, sharpening, retouching, and presenting your photos like a pro. You'll learn how to unlock the power of all the new Elements 3 features, including how to manage your photos using the new Organizer, how to use the new "pro tools" like the Healing Brush and the Shadow/Highlight controls, and how to master the new "Creation" section to take your photos to an entirely new level. Plus, you'll see it all step-by-step, in plain English, and you'll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective these techniques are, once you know the secrets.You'll learn: The secrets of how the pros retouch portraits How to incorporate the amazing new features of Elements 3 into your work today! How to color correct any photo without breaking a sweat (you'll be amazed at how they do it!) How to repair and restore damaged photos The sharpening techniques the pros really use (there's an entire chapter just on this!) Dealing with common digital camera image problems, including removing noise and avoiding halos When to use Quick Fix, and when to do to it yourself (using our step-by-step methods). The most-requested photographic special effects and much more! But besides all that, this book has a "secret weapon" that makes it the most important, most useful Elements book yet. The reason is this--although Elements 3 offers some digital photography features Photoshop CS doesn't offer, there are plenty of features that Photoshop CS has, that Elements 3 still doesn't have (things like Layer Masking, Channel Mixer, etc.). But in this book, you'll learn some slick workarounds, cheats, and some fairly ingenious ways to replicate many of those Photoshop features from right within Elements. There's never been a book like it, and if you're a digital photographer using Photoshop Elements 3, this is the book you've been waiting for.

A comprehensive analysis of the motivations of Wikipedians is conducted using the iterative methodology developed by Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn in Value Sensitive Design and Information Systems and co-developed by Nissenbaum and Friedman in Bias in Computer Systems. The Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach consists of three stages: Empirical Investigation, Conceptual Investigation, and Technical Investigation. During the empirical phase, motivations of the contributors to Wikipedia are identified through analysis of data from two published surveys and a pilot survey conducted at New York University. The underlying values behind these motivations are then defined in the conceptual phase of the study. Finally, a technical investigation is conducted in order to determine how features of the Wiki technology support and facilitate these values.

Journal of Neuroscience, 22, 9475-9489] have published a non-human primate study on visual decision making. They collected both behavioral and neurophysiological data and provided evidence that the data are qualitatively consistent with a mechanism based on accumulating sensory evidence up to a decision threshold. I have previously demonstrated that a time-variant diffusion model can account quite well quantitatively for both the behavioral and the neural data. In this manuscript I discuss how well the data constrains different components and parameters of the computational process. I also discuss the biological plausibility of the model parameters. I will demonstrate that a relatively large class of models, both with and without temporal integration and both stationary and time-variant could account for the behavioral data. Both the single cell recordings from the parietal cortex and previously published data from the extrastriate visual cortex provide additional constraints. Overall, the data favor a diffusion model with time-variant gain and leaky integrators. The integration time constant, however, turns out not to be well-constrained by the data.

#!We present a modification to the Berger and Oliger adaptive mesh refinement algorithm designed to solve systems of coupled, non-linear, hyperbolic and elliptic partial differential equations. Such systems typically arise during constrained evolution of the field equations of general relativity. The novel aspect of this algorithm is a technique of "extrapolation and delayed solution" used to deal with the non-local nature of the solution of the elliptic equations, driven by dynamical sources, within the usual Berger and Oliger time-stepping framework. We show empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in axisymmetric gravitational collapse simulations, and further demonstrate that the solution time scales approximately linearly with problem size. We also describe several other details of the code, including truncation error estimation using a self-shadow hierarchy, and the refinement-boundary interpolation operators that are used to help suppress spurious high-frequency solution components ("noise").

Our approach is based on the assumption that if a blog has the relationships with others, they would use the similar set of tags. We collect the sample data from blogosphere randomly and then build the concept hierarchies on the basis of the inclusion relations(tags) between the extensions(bloggers). We propose the formalization of the contextualized folksonomy in terms of Formal Concept Analysis and show how our approach can be used to create the contextualized folksonmy for blogosphere. We evaluate our approach by considering an already existing tags of blogosphere.

At the same time, social communities are emerging on the Web, applying less formal practices and Web 2.0 technology for the dissemination and aggregation of diverse content. In this paper, we are interested in the combination of these two trends in the form of service communities: social and business communities exchanging services. We discuss applications of service communities and introduce the concept of Service Clubs as a structuring mechanism for communities. Clubs have been specifically designed to support community-based, per-project interaction and composition of services.

We give a complete characterization of NIR Clos networks built of switching elements of various nonblocking properties. In particular, we propose a novel class of NIR Clos networks that leads to recursive constructions of various cost-efficient multistage NIR networks. Finally, we present examples of such constructions and compare them with the best previously known results.

#!A method based on oriented connectivity that can automatically segment arc-like structures (solar loops) from intensity images of the Sun's corona is introduced. The method is a constructive approach that uses model-guided processing to enable extraction of credible loop structures. Since the solar loops are vestiges of the solar magnetic field, the model-guided processing exploits external estimates of this field's local orientations that are derived from a physical magnetic field model. Empirical studies of the method's effectiveness are also presented. The oriented connectivity-based method is the first automatic method for the segmentation of solar loops.

#!This paper proposes an approach to join the analytical system to the real-time operational war game system. The interoperability issues of these two heterogeneous war game systems are fully explored in this paper. The purpose of interoperability among heterogeneous systems is to extend the capability of the joint systems beyond their originally designed purposes. This paper starts with the purpose of interoperability to categorize the types of the heterogeneous joint simulation. The technical issue and architecture of the heterogeneous joint simulation environment are then explored. Our experiment shows that the proposed method of using the analytical system as the decision support system is feasible and efficient approach to provide a heterogeneous joint training environment.

#*Performance modelling of TCP enhancements in terrestrial-satellite hybrid networks

#!In this paper, we focus on the performance of TCP enhancements for a hybrid terrestrial-satellite network. While a large body of literature exists regarding modeling TCP performance for the wired Internet, and recently over a single-hop wireless link, the literature is very sparse on TCP analysis over a hybrid wired-wireless (multi-hop) path. We seek to make a contribution to this problem (where the wireless segment is a satellite uplink) by deriving analytical estimates of TCP throughput for two widely deployed approaches: TCP splitting and E2E (End-to-End) TCP with link layer support as a function of key parameters such as terrestrial/satellite propagation delay, segment loss rate and buffer size. Our analysis is supported by simulations; throughput comparisons indicate superiority of TCP splitting over E2E scheme in most cases. However, in situations where end-to-end delay is dominated by terrestrial portion and buffering is very limited at intermediate node, E2E achieves higher throughput than TCP splitting.

#!Face is considered to be one of the biometrics in automatic person identification. The non-intrusive nature of face recognition makes it an attractive choice. For face recognition system to be practical, it should be robust to variations in illumination, pose and expression as humans recognize faces irrespective of all these variations. In this paper, an attempt to address these issues is made using a new Hausdorff distance-based measure. The proposed measure represent the gray values of pixels in face images as vectors giving the neighborhood intensity distribution of the pixels. The transformation is expected to be less sensitive to illumination variations besides preserving the appearance of face embedded in the original gray image. While the existing Hausdorff distance-based measures are defined between the binary edge images of faces which contains primarily structural information, the proposed measure gives the dissimilarity between the appearance of faces. An efficient method to compute the proposed measure is presented. The performance of the method on bench mark face databases shows that it is robust to considerable variations in pose, expression and illumination. Comparison with some of the existing Hausdorff distance-based methods shows that the proposed method performs better in many cases.

#*Cisco IOS Cookbook

#t2006

#index3255
#!Never has something cried out for a cookbook quite as much as Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS). IOS is powerful and flexible, but also confusing and daunting. Most tasks can be accomplished in several different ways. And you don't want to spend precious time figuring out which way is best when you're trying to solve a problem quickly. That's what this cookbook is for. Fortunately, most router configuration tasks can be broken down into several more or less independent steps: you configure an interface, you configure a routing protocol, you set up backup links, you implement packet filters and other access control mechanisms. What you really need is a set of recipes that show you how to perform the most common tasks, so you can quickly come up with a good configuration for your site. And you need to know that these solutions work: you don't want to find yourself implementing a backup link at 2 A.M. because your main link is down and the backup link you set up when you installed the router wasn't quite right.Thoroughly revised and expanded, Cisco IOS Cookbook, 2nd Edition, adds sections on MPLS, Security, IPv6, and IP Mobility, and presents solutions to the most common configuration problems, including:Configuring interfaces of many types, from serial to ATM and Frame RelayConfiguring all of the common IP routing protocols (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP)Configuring authenticationConfiguring other services, including DHCP and NTPSetting up backup links, and using HSRP to configure backup routersManaging the router, including SNMP and other solutionsUsing access lists to control the traffic through the routerIf you work with Cisco routers, you need a book like this to help you solve problems quickly and effectively. Even if you're experienced, the solutions and extensive explanations will give you new ideas and insights into router configuration. And if you're not experienced--if you've just been given responsibility for managing a network with Cisco routers--this book could be a job-saver.

#!In this paper, we describe our experience with the design and implementation of an embodied conversational agent (ECA) that converses with users to change their dietary behavior. Our intent is to develop a system that dynamically models the agent and the user and adapts the agent's counseling dialog accordingly. Towards this end, we discuss our efforts to automatically determine the user's dietary behavior stage of change and attitude towards the agent on the basis of unconstrained typed text dialog, first with another person and then with an ECA controlled by an experimenter in a wizard of Oz study. We describe how the results of these studies have been incorporated into an algorithm that combines the results from simple parsing rules together with contextual features using a Bayesian network to determine user stage and attitude automatically.

#!Support vector machine (SVM) theory was originally developed on the basis of a linearly separable binary classification problem, and other approaches have been later introduced for this problem. In this paper it is demonstrated that all these approaches admit the same dual problem formulation in the linearly separable case and that all the solutions are equivalent. For the non-linearly separable case, all the approaches can also be formulated as a unique dual optimization problem, however, their solutions are not equivalent. Discussions and remarks in the article point to an in-depth comparison between SVM formulations and associated parameters.

Now, new owner Adobe is taking Flash and its powerful capabilities beyond the Web and making it a full-fledged development environment. Rather than focus on theory, the ActionScript 3.0 Cookbook concentrates on the practical application of ActionScript, with more than 300 solutions you can use to solve a wide range of common coding dilemmas. You'll find recipes that show you how to:Detect the user's Flash Player version or their operating systemBuild custom classesFormat dates and currency typesWork with stringsBuild user interface componentsWork with audio and videoMake remote procedure calls using Flash Remoting and web servicesLoad, send, and search XML dataAnd much, much more ...Each code recipe presents the Problem, Solution, and Discussion of how you can use it in other ways or personalize it for your own needs, and why it works. You can quickly locate the recipe that most closely matches your situation and get the solution without reading the whole book to understand the underlying code. Solutions progress from short recipes for small problems to more complex scripts for thornier riddles, and the discussions offer a deeper analysis for resolving similar issues in the future, along with possible design choices and ramifications. You'll even learn how to link modular ActionScript pieces together to create rock-solid solutions for Flex 2 and Flash applications.When you're not sure how ActionScript 3.0 works or how to approach a specific programming dilemma, you can simply pick up the book, flip to the relevant recipe(s), and quickly find the solution you're looking for.Adobe Developer Library is a co-publishing partnership between O'Reilly Media and Adobe Systems, Inc. and is designed to produce the number one information resources for developers who use Adobe technologies.

#!Security-critical applications at the highest Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) require formal proofs of correctness in order to achieve certification. To support secure application development at the highest EALs, we have developed techniques to largely automate the process of producing proofs of correctness of machine code. As part of the Secure, High-Assurance Development Environment program, we have produced in ACL2 an executable formal model of the Rockwell Collins AAMP7G microprocessor at the instruction set level, in order to facilitate proofs of correctness about that processor's machine code. The AAMP7G, currently in use in Rockwell Collins secure system products, supports strict time and space partitioning in hardware, and has received a U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) certificate based in part on a formal proof of correctness of its separation kernel microcode. Proofs of correctness of AAMP7G machine code are accomplished using the method of "compositional cutpoints", which requires neither traditional clock functions nor a Verification Condition Generator (VCG). In this paper, we will summarize the AAMP7G architecture, detail our ACL2 model of the processor, and describe our development of the compositional cutpoint method into a robust machine code proof framework.

#!In [7], a new information&dash;theoretic attribute selection method for decision tree induction was introduced. This method consists in computing for each node, a distance between the partition generated by the values of each candidate attribute in the node and the correct partition of the subset of training examples in this node. The chosen attribute is that whose corresponding partition is the closest to the correct partition (i.e., the partition that perfectly classifies the training data). In that paper it was also formally proved that such distance is not biased towards attributes with a large number of values in the sense specified by Quinlan in [12] and some initial experimental evidence suggests that the predictive accuracy of the induced trees was not significantly different from that obtained with the most widely used information theoretic attribute selection measures, that is, Quinlan&rsquo;s Gain and Quinlan&rsquo;s Gain Ratio. However, it seemed that the distance induced smaller trees especially when the attributes had different number of values. In that paper it was not confirmed that the differences were statistically significant due to the small number of experiments performed. In this paper we report experimental results that allow to confirm that the distance induces trees whose size, without losing accuracy, is not significantly different from those obtained using Quinlan&rsquo;s Gain but smaller than those obtained with Quinlan&rsquo;s Gain Ratio. These experimental results are supported by a statistical analysis performed using two statistical hypothesis tests&colon; the sign test and the signed rank test.

#!This paper presents a new fingerprint singular point detection method that is type-distinguishable and applicable to various fingerprint images regardless of their resolutions. The proposed method detects singular points by analyzing the shapes of the local directional fields of a fingerprint image. Using the predefined rules, all types of singular points (upper core, lower core, and delta points) can be extracted accurately and delineated in terms of the type of singular points. In case of arch-type fingerprints there exists no singular point, but reference points for arch-type fingerprints are required to be detected for registration. Therefore, we propose a new reference point detection method for arch-type fingerprints as well. The result of the experiments on the two public databases (FVC2000 2a, FVC2002 2a) with different resolutions demonstrates that the proposed method has high accuracy in locating each types of singular points and detecting the reference points of arch-type fingerprints without regard to their image resolutions.

#!Internet trace packet data for a given network link contains information on each packet's arrival time and size. An important problem is to model the congestion packets experienced over the collection period. Recent research has utilized a relationship from Queueing Theory known as Lindley's Recursion to model packet congestion. This relationship has existed for 50 years and has been quite beneficial in analyzing these traces. We report on our use of Lindley's Recursion to analyze publicly-available link data from the Abilene Network, an Internet2 backbone network. We extend the use of Lindley's Recursion and include a discussion of the computational problems, numerical evaluation of trace packet performance and potential modeling issues, and a statistical investigation of the independence of packet interarrival times. In addition, we show how Lindley's Recursion can be used to extend the baseline analysis to interject Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) packets into the trace.

#!We consider blind, deterministic, finite automata equipped with a register which stores an element of a given monoid, and which is modified by right multiplication by monoid elements. We show that, for monoids M drawn from a large class including groups, such an automaton accepts the word problem of a group H if and only if H has a finite index subgroup which embeds in the group of units of M. In the case that M is a group, this answers a question of Elston and Ostheimer.

The applications of this problem can be found in various engineering fields, typically in the design of telephone networks, in the planning of highway systems or in the design of large mining operations. In the present state of art, for 20 given points or more, one must use a heuristic method to obtain at least a suboptimum solution in a reasonable time.

#!This paper develops a novel framework that is capable of dealing with small sample size problem posed to subspace analysis methods for face representation and recognition. In the proposed framework, three aspects are presented. The first is the proposal of an iterative sampling technique. The second is adopting divide-conquer-merge strategy to incorporate the iterative sampling technique and subspace analysis method. The third is that the essence of 2D PCA is further explored. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional algorithms.

#!Soccer ball detection and tracking plays a pivotal role in soccer event detection. In fact, all events in the game take place around the ball, and it is crucial to track the movement of the ball, players of both teams as well as the referee in order to perform analysis of the match both real-time and post match. A ball, player and referee detection, classification and tracking; team identification, and a field extraction approach is proposed in this paper. A higher level automatic offside event (OE) detection method is also proposed. The principle constraint considered during the development of the system was that the pattern recognition techniques had to be computationally efficient in terms of processing time. The system developed is a non-invasive vision-based decision support tool, capable of providing real-time analysis of a soccer match, including assisting the referee in making a decision concerning the offside rule.

#!Flash memory is the most prevalent storage medium found on modern wireless sensor devices (WSDs). In this article we present two external memory index structures for the efficient retrieval of records stored on the local flash memory of a WSD. Our index structures, MicroHash and MicroGF (micro grid files), exploit the asymmetric read/write and wear characteristics of flash memory in order to offer high-performance indexing and searching capabilities in the presence of a low-energy budget, which is typical for the devices under discussion. Both structures organize data and index pages on the flash media using a sorted by timestamp file organization. A key idea behind these index structures is that expensive random access deletions are completely eliminated. MicroHash enables equality searches by value in constant time and equality searches by timestamp in logarithmic time at a small cost of storing index pages on the flash media. Similarly, MicroGF enables spatial equality and proximity searches in constant time. We have implemented these index structures in nesC, the programming language of the TinyOS operating system. Our trace-driven experimentation with several real datasets reveals that our index structures offer excellent search performance at a small cost of constructing and maintaining the index.

#!We describe an approach for modeling and diagnosing complex multi&dash;modal systems. A novel feature of this approach is the proposed method for integrating multiple specification modalities. We apply this approach to a real&dash;world rocket engine turbopump. The example model consists of two sub&dash;models, one describing liquid flows, and one describing mechanical vibrations. Typical methods for modeling such systems will treat these two modalities as being completely disjoint, even though they have significant interactions. We describe a method for integrating these sub&dash;models using variables that play different roles in the different sub&dash;models. We focus on how the integrated causal network model allows us to diagnose a more complete and physically plausible set of faults than by using the independent sub&dash;models.

#!An adaptive watermarking capacity analysis in the spatial domain and wavelet domain is proposed. The relationship between the watermarking capacity and the watermark detection error rate is also discussed. The research of watermark detection error rate will help us finding the ways to embed more watermark messages while keeping an acceptable detection error rate, and it is useful for the design of the general algorithms of watermarking and detection. The watermarking system is analyzed based on the channel capacity and error rate of the communication system, and the relation between the detection error rate with the capacity and payload capacity is derived. According to the experimental results, the detection error rate of watermark is mainly influenced by the watermark average energy and the watermarking capacity. The error rate rises with the increase of watermarking capacity. When the channel coding is used, the watermarking error rate drops with the decrease of the payload capacity of watermarking.

#!In wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs), sensors monitor the environment based on which the sink issues commands to actors to act on the environment. In order to provide tight coupling between sensing and acting, an effective coordination mechanism is required among sensors and actors. In this context, we identify the problem of "hazards", which is the out-of-order execution of commands and queries due to lack of coordination between sensors and actors. We identify three hazards and show with an example application, the undesirable consequences of these hazards. We also outline the basic design needed to address this problem efficiently.

#!The paper tackles the problem of feature points matching between pair of images of the same scene. This is a key problem in computer vision. The method we discuss here is a version of the SVD-matching proposed by Scott and Longuet-Higgins and later modified by Pilu, that we elaborate in order to cope with large scale variations. To this end we add to the feature detection phase a keypoint descriptor that is robust to large scale and view-point changes. Furthermore, we include this descriptor in the equations of the proximity matrix that is central to the SVD-matching. At the same time we remove from the proximity matrix all the information about the point locations in the image, that is the source of mismatches when the amount of scene variation increases. The main contribution of this work is in showing that this compact and easy algorithm can be used for severe scene variations. We present experimental evidence of the improved performance with respect to the previous versions of the algorithm.

#!Stratified objects such as those found in geometry-based systems (e.g. CAD systems and animation systems) can be stepwise constructed and manipulated through Euler operators. The operators proposed in this paper extend prior operators (e.g. the Euler-Masuda operators) provided that they can process n-dimensional stratified subanalytic objects with incomplete boundaries. The subanalytic objects form the biggest closed family of geometric objects defined by analytic functions. Basically, such operators are attachment, detachment, subdivision, and coaslescence operations without a prescribed order, providing the user with significant freedom in the design and programming of geometric applications.

#!A new direct constrained optimization algorithm for minimizing the Kohn-Sham (KS) total energy functional is presented in this paper. The key ingredients of this algorithm involve projecting the total energy functional into a sequence of subspaces of small dimensions and seeking the minimizer of total energy functional within each subspace. The minimizer of a subspace energy functional not only provides a search direction along which the KS total energy functional decreases but also gives an optimal "step-length" to move along this search direction. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that this new direct constrained optimization algorithm can be more efficient than the self-consistent field (SCF) iteration.

#!In this paper we evaluate the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) via packet simulations. EIGRP, an intra-domain routing protocol developed by Cisco, is mainly based on the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) which computes shortest paths distributedly without creating routing-table loops or incurring counting-to-infinity problem. Previous studies showed EIGRP's ability to adapt quickly to routing changes in medium-scale networks. In our research, we developed a detailed simulation model of EIGRP (publicly available), and we used it to evaluate EIGRP performance under a very dynamic network. Our results showed that EIGRP converges faster than a single TCP timeout in most cases. The simulated network was a composite of wired and wireless hosts, and the results hold for both types of media. In addition, the study showed a feasible approach for seamless mobility and continuous connectivity for users of mobile wireless devices as they move within an Autonomous System (AS).

#!How do real graphs evolve over time&quest; What are normal growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks&quest; Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time. Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)). Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study. We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point. Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution.

#!Prototype-based classification relies on the distances between the examples to be classified and carefully chosen prototypes. A small set of prototypes is of interest to keep the computational complexity low, while maintaining high classification accuracy. An experimental study of some old and new prototype optimisation techniques is presented, in which the prototypes are either selected or generated from the given data. These condensing techniques are evaluated on real data, represented in vector spaces, by comparing their resulting reduction rates and classification performance. Usually the determination of prototypes is studied in relation with the nearest neighbour rule. We will show that the use of more general dissimilarity-based classifiers can be more beneficial. An important point in our study is that the adaptive condensing schemes here discussed allow the user to choose the number of prototypes freely according to the needs. If such techniques are combined with linear dissimilarity-based classifiers, they provide the best trade-off of small condensed sets and high classification accuracy.

#!The mental scripts that prescribe the way people interact with other people or with computers are experientially characterized and context sensitive. For this reason, CASA research should be more sensitive to the divergent nature of social scripts, through which people respond to human features on interfaces and through which they treat computers as social actors. Using politeness as an example, this study first investigated people's politeness orientations, and then their perceptions of websites containing error pages with messages featuring three different politeness strategies. Two hundred thirty-four senior high school students participated in this three (politeness orientations) by three (error messages) by two (frustration levels)-factorial experiment. Three-way ANOVAs and simple main effects analyses showed that people with different politeness orientations do respond differently to messages with different politeness strategies and different levels of associated frustration. This study shows that more research effort should be focused on whether and how the CASA phenomenon manifests itself in different computer-use situations and/or with different people.

#!Node-selecting queries over trees lie at the core of several important XML languages for the web, such as the node-selection language XPath, the query language XQuery, and the transformation language XSLT. The main syntactic constructs of such queries are the backward predicates, for example, ancestor and preceding, and the forward predicates, for example, descendant and following. Forward predicates are included in the depth-first, left-to-right preorder relation associated with the input tree, whereas backward predicates are included in the inverse of this preorder relation. This work is devoted to an expressiveness study of node-selecting queries with proven theoretical and practical applicability, especially in the field of query evaluation against XML streams. The main question it answers positively is whether, for each input query with forward and backward predicates, there exists an equivalent forward-only output query. This question is then positively answered for input and output queries of varying structural complexity, using LOGLIN and PSPACE reductions. Various existing applications based on the results of this work are reported, including query optimization and streamed evaluation.

#!Pointer analysis benefits many useful clients, such as compiler optimizations and bug finding tools. Unfortunately, common programming language features such as dynamic loading, reflection, and foreign language interfaces, make pointer analysis difficult. This article describes how to deal with these features by performing pointer analysis online during program execution. For example, dynamic loading may load code that is not available for analysis before the program starts. Only an online analysis can analyze such code, and thus support clients that optimize or find bugs in it. This article identifies all problems in performing Andersen's pointer analysis for the full Java language, presents solutions to these problems, and uses a full implementation of the solutions in a Java virtual machine for validation and performance evaluation. Our analysis is fast: On average over our benchmark suite, if the analysis recomputes points-to results upon each program change, most analysis pauses take under 0.1 seconds, and add up to 64.5 seconds.

#!To make it practical to mechanize proofs in programming language metatheory, several capabilities are required of the theorem proving framework. One must be able to represent and efficiently reason about complex recursively-defined expressions, define arbitrary induction schemes including mutual inductions over several objects and inductions over derivations, and reason about variable bindings with minimal overhead. We introduce a method for performing these proofs in ACL2, including a macro which automates the process of defining functions and theorems to facilitate reasoning about recursive data types. To illustrate this method, we present a proof in ACL2 of the soundness of the simply typed &lambda;-calculus.

#!Challenging object detection and segmentation tasks can be facilitated by the availability of a reference object. However, accounting for possible transformations between the different object views, as part of the segmentation process, remains difficult. Recent statistical methods address this problem by using comprehensive training data. Other techniques can only accommodate similarity transformations. We suggest a novel variational approach to prior-based segmentation, using a single reference object, that accounts for planar projective transformation. Generalizing the Chan-Vese level set framework, we introduce a novel shape-similarity measure and embed the projective homography between the prior shape and the image to segment within a region-based segmentation functional. The proposed algorithm detects the object of interest, extracts its boundaries, and concurrently carries out the registration to the prior shape. We demonstrate prior-based segmentation on a variety of images and verify the accuracy of the recovered transformation parameters.

#!This paper introduces a novel framework for 3D head model recognition based on the recently proposed 2D subspace analysis method. Two main contributions have been made. First, a 2D version of clustering-based discriminant analysis (CDA) is proposed, which combines the capability to model the multiple cluster structure embedded within a single class with the computational advantage that is characteristic of 2D subspace analysis methods. Second, we extend the applications of 2D subspace methods to the field of 3D head model classification by characterizing these models with 2D feature sets.

With Flash, you can integrate video, text, audio, and graphics into distinctive and compelling web content, stunningly interactive and expressive user interfaces, and rich applications for the Internet. Flash is all about helping you dramatically enhance the user experience. And Flash Out of the Box is all about helping you think outside of the box to get there--first, by diving into the Flash box and then becoming intimately acquainted with every nook and cranny of it. In Flash Out of the Box, you'll follow and work with a simple box through a "day in the life" style journey. You'll study, use, abuse, and transform the box as you move through exercises that teach you the basics of Flash, and much more, in an entertaining, unforgettable, task-oriented fashion. You'll learn to animate, work with video, load external assets, draw, mask, modularize, and many other things that will be essential as you move into more advanced techniques with other books. It's just you, Flash, and the box, mastering each technique along the way and adding others in a fashion that will let you practice and learn simultaneously. Most Flash tutorials you've looked at are tool-centric, focusing on Flash's individual features and how to use them (an approach that can quickly become tedious), whereas this innovative, engaging, and motivating book is uniquely user-centric. That means it concentrates on you and what you want and need to learn. Each successive lesson anticipates and builds upon your needs, capabilities, and questions as you evolve from Flash beginner to Flash master. Written in a fun and conversational tone, the highly accessible Flash Out of the Box makes learning Flash MX 2004 intuitive, logical, and, most of all, fun.

#index3515
#!The management of a global activity that has individual tasks as its components is very difficult, because an unexpected interruption in any individual task can create extra costs or even disrupt the whole activity. To resolve this problem, this work presents the development of a decision-support tool using Bayesian networks (BN). Our research illustrates how to model the relationship between the total time of a process and the time of the individual tasks selected as relevant. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to construct dynamic scenarios on the BN which allow us to track and manage a global activity. The BN is useful because the activities have random characteristics and the information about individual tasks can be propagated throughout the global activity scenario and associated with costs. This offers the administrator a tool for proactive task management and risk reduction.

#!Internet quality of service (QoS) is still a highly debated topic for more than fifteen years. Even with the large variety of QoS proposals and the impressive research advances, there is little deployment yet of network layer QoS technology. One specific problem domain is QoS signalling, which has recently attracted increasing attention to bring forward new standardization approaches. In this paper, an extensive study of RSVP is presented, covering protocol design, software design, and performance aspects of the basic version of RSVP and of certain standardized and experimental extensions. This work is based on and presents the experience from implementing RSVP for UNIX systems and the ns-2 simulation environment. The implementation includes a variety of protocol extensions and incorporates several internal improvements. It has been subject to extensive functional and performance evaluations, the results of which are reported here.

#!According to artificial intelligence studies, goal-based and utility-based agents can select an action to attain a desired outcome. The goal-based agent sets a specific goal regardless of its utility at first, and selects the action that leads to that goal (goal-based action selection). The utility-based agent compares the utilities of different possible outcomes, and selects the action that causes the outcome with the highest utility (utility-based action bias). The medial prefrontal cortex is involved in implementing the goal-based action selection and the striatum is involved in implementing the utility-based action bias. Goal-based action selection may be temporarily dominant over the utility-based action bias in a new environment, whereas the utility-based action bias becomes dominant after acquisition of action utilities in the environment. This transition of dominance between the two decision systems may be enhanced by a reference-point shift based on the goal-setting process during goal-based action selection.

#!A multi-step recognition process is developed for extracting compound forest cover information from manually produced scanned historical topographic maps of the 19th century. This information is a unique data source for GIS-based land cover change modeling. Based on salient features in the image the steps to be carried out are character recognition, line detection and structural analysis of forest symbols. Semantic expansion implying the meanings of objects is applied for final forest cover extraction. The procedure resulted in high accuracies of 94% indicating a potential for automatic and robust extraction of forest cover from larger areas.

#!Using web services to expose applications over the Internet is now a widely accepted practice. Currently, there are several ongoing efforts that provide ways to effectively compose web services distributed across different organizations. One of the problems underlying the deployment of such composite services on the web, however, is service co-allocation that arises when a composite service needs to ensure all the required component services to be available for execution at the same time. Motivated by this, this paper presents a new decentralized protocol, named web service co-allocation protocol (WSCP), which can facilitate fast execution of composite web services. The proposed framework is an enhancement of the famous two phase commit protocol through the incorporation of tentative hold phase as well as the employment of a new high performance backoff protocol developed to better address the dynamics of the service co-allocation problem. The simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant improvements over existing protocols.

#!Studies of facial parts have been conducted in recent years in various fields of medical science and psychology, including studies of the lip contour and location. In fact, in the treatment of cleft lip patients in oral surgery, it is desirable to extract the precise lip contour and to identify its location on the face in order to plan the plastic surgery procedure and to follow up the site after surgery. Aiming at applications to dental treatment, in this study we attempt to extend the lip contour extraction procedure based on the deformable template to the case of a template with left&ndash; right asymmetry. An algorithm is also proposed for adjusting the hue and value thresholds in order to improve extraction accuracy and reduce the burden on the user. The proposal is evaluated using sample images of normal subjects and cleft lip patients. It is shown that the shape and location of the lip can be extracted precisely and automatically by the proposed method. In connection with application to dental clinics, we present an example of a quantitative evaluation of the lip shape by using the parameters extracted by the proposed method. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!Automatic extraction of semantic information from text and links in Web pages is key to improving the quality of search results. However, the assessment of automatic semantic measures is limited by the coverage of user studies, which do not scale with the size, heterogeneity, and growth of the Web. Here we propose to leverage human-generated metadata--namely topical directories--to measure semantic relationships among massive numbers of pairs of Web pages or topics. The Open Directory Project classifies millions of URLs in a topical ontology, providing a rich source from which semantic relationships between Web pages can be derived. While semantic similarity measures based on taxonomies (trees) are well studied, the design of well-founded similarity measures for objects stored in the nodes of arbitrary ontologies (graphs) is an open problem. This paper defines an information-theoretic measure of semantic similarity that exploits both the hierarchical and non-hierarchical structure of an ontology. An experimental study shows that this measure improves significantly on the traditional taxonomy-based approach. This novel measure allows us to address the general question of how text and link analyses can be combined to derive measures of relevance that are in good agreement with semantic similarity. Surprisingly, the traditional use of text similarity turns out to be ineffective for relevance ranking.

#!Reflective middleware has been proposed as an effective way to enhance adaptability of component-oriented middleware architectures. To be effectively adaptable, the implementation of reflective middleware needs to be modular. However, some recently emerged applications such as mobile, pervasive, and embedded applications have imposed more stringent modularity requirements to the middleware design. They require support for the conception of a minimal middleware while promoting finegrained modularity of reflective middleware features. The key problem is that fundamental mechanisms for decomposing reflective middleware implementations, such as object-oriented ones, suffer from not providing the proper means to achieve the required level of localizing reflection-specific concerns. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how aspect-oriented programming scales up to improve modularity of typical reflection-specific crosscutting concerns. We have quantitatively compared Java and AspectJ implementations of an OpenORB-compliant reflective middleware using separation of concerns metrics.

A crucial role for the analysis played the Chan---Games algorithm. We use a more sophisticated generalization of the Chan---Games algorithm by Ding et al. to obtain exact formulas for the counting function and the expected value for the 1-error linear complexity for p n -periodic sequences over $${\mathbb{F}_{p, p}}$$ prime. Additionally we discuss the calculation of lower and upper bounds on the k-error linear complexity of p n -periodic sequences over $${\mathbb{F}_{p}}$$ .

Since face detection heavily benefits from the possibility to exploit tracking, multi-camera people tracking has been integrated with a face detector based on colour clustering and Hough transform. Moreover, the multiple viewpoints provided by multiple cameras are exploited in order to always obtain a good-quality image of the face. The identity of people in different views is kept consistent by means of a geometrical, uncalibrated approach based on homographies. Experimental results show the accuracy of the proposed approach.

#!Despite the fact that there is nothing as practical as a good theory such theories seem to lag behind practical applications. The reason is that theoretical investigations need a certain distance and maturity in order to produce good theories. They provide, however, valuable guidelines, even if, due to the necessary simplifications, the results are not directly applicable: they play a valuable role as signal posts.

#!In this paper we propose a user profile based approach for supporting Web-oriented search. Differently from traditional syntax-based approaches, our method is semantic driven. Indeed, for each user, a profile is constructed and handled for representing her/his interests. Whenever a user submits a query, a classical Web search engine is activated for determining a (probably large) set of answer data sources. After this, the user profile is exploited for determining the subset of those data sources which best conforms to user interests. In order to semantically compare the content of a data source with a user profile, a formal inference framework, provided by a specialized probabilistic variant of Description Logics, is exploited.

#!A symmetric design with parameters v = q 2(q + 2), k = q(q + 1), ¿ = q, q ¿ 2, is called a quasi-affine design if its point set can be partitioned into q + 2 subsets P 0, P 1,..., P q , P q+1 such that the induced structure in every point neighborhood is an affine plane of order q (repeated q times). A quasi-affine design with q ¿ 3 determines its point neighborhoods uniquely and dual of such a design is also a quasi-affine design. These structural properties pave way for definition of a strongly quasi-affine design and it is also shown that associated with every quasi-affine design is a unique strongly quasi-affine design from which the given quasi-affine design is obtained by certain unique cutting and pasting operation. This investigation also enables us to associate a unique 2-regular graph with q + 2 vertices and in turn, a unique colored partition of the integer q + 2. These combinatorial consequences are finally used to obtain an exponential lower bound on the number of non-isomorphic solutions of such symmetric designs improving the earlier lower bound of 2.

#index3571
#!In prior reports (J.R. Marsden, R. Pakath, K. Wibowo, Decision making under time pressure with different information sources and performance-based financial incentives: Part 1, Decision Support Systems, 34 (2002) 75-97, J.R. Marsden, R. Pakath, K. Wibowo, Decision making under time pressure with different information sources and performance-based financial incentives: Part 2, Decision Support Systems, 34 (2002) 99-124), we describe the design and implementation of a software platform and a laboratory experiment aimed at a preliminary investigation of the efficacy of an alternative communication language for a time-pressured, incentive-driven decision-making setting. Our experimental findings suggest that, despite its relative novelty, the alternative language is at least as effective as the more traditional communication modes of written and spoken English in the specific setting examined, while succinctly conveying what must be conveyed. That work embodies three central underlying constructs--information communication mode, communication speed, and complexity level. The analysis in (J.R. Marsden, R. Pakath, K. Wibowo, Decision making under time pressure with different information sources and performance-based financial incentives: Part 2, Decision Support Systems, 34 (2002) 99-124) focuses solely on mode. In this concluding portion of the research, we analyze the two remaining constructs--speed and complexity level. Taken together with that in (J.R. Marsden, R. Pakath, K. Wibowo, Decision making under time pressure with different information sources and performance-based financial incentives: Part 2, Decision Support Systems, 34 (2002) 99-124), our analysis enables a fuller understanding of the interplay between communication mode, speed, and complexity. We note two particular findings of our research: (1) whereas real-world systems are often designed based on prescriptive tradition, including "best practice" criteria widely disseminated and adopted by practitioners without demonstrated benefits to users, in our study, we found that performance at any level of a particular construct was typically sensitive to the levels set for the remaining two attributes, and (2) despite the fact that many experimental studies (e.g., (D.M. Miranda, R.P. Bostrom, The impact of group support systems on group conflict and conflict management, Journal of Management Information Systems, 10 (3), (1993), 63-95, H. Nysveen, P.E. Pedersen, An exploratory study of customers' perception of company web sites offering various interactive applications: moderating effects of customers' Internet experience, Decision Support Systems, 37 (1) (2004), 137-150)) continue to emphasize subject perception over more objective performance measures, in our study, we found that subject preexperimental perceptions did not always coincide with actual experimental outcomes. Our work, like most controlled experimental analyses, is subject to caveats related to limited sample size and specific orderings examined.

#!This paper addresses the computation of the fundamental matrix between two views, when camera motion and 3D structure are unknown, but planar surfaces can be assumed. We use line features which are automatically matched in two steps. Firstly, with image based parameters, a set of matches are obtained to secondly compute homographies, which allows to reject wrong ones, and to grow good matches in a final stage. The inclusion of projective transformations gives much better results to match features with short computing overload. When two or more planes are observed, different homographies can be computed, segmenting simultaneously the corresponding planar surfaces. These can be used to obtain the fundamental matrix, which gives constraints for the whole scene. The results show that the global process is robust enough, turning out stable and useful to obtain matches and epipolar geometry from lines in man made environments.

#!The purpose of this article is to review the findings of Professor Fujikoshi which are primarily in multivariate analysis. He derived many asymptotic expansions for multivariate statistics which include MANOVA tests, dimensionality tests and latent roots under normality and nonnormality. He has made a large contribution in the study on theoretical accuracy for asymptotic expansions by deriving explicit error bounds. A large contribution has been also made in an important problem involving the selection of variables with introducing "no additional information hypotheses" in some multivariate models and the application of model selection criteria. Recently he is challenging to a high-dimensional statistical problem. He has been involved in other topics in multivariate analysis, such as power comparison of a class of tests, monotone transformations with improved approximations, etc.

#!Simulation-based Early Warning Systems (SEWS) support proactive control of real material flow systems. In consequence of real or potential state changes, proactive control (unlike reactive control) makes foresighted and targetoriented acting possible. Starting from the definition of SEWS their architecture and the requirements for design of SEWS are discussed. The compliance with simulatorindependency is one important facet. Basically, this is achieved by the use of Web Services, XML and XSD (XML Schema Definition). One key component of SEWS are online simulation models which are initialized with the current system state of a real system. The utilization of RFID technology to generate information about current system states improves the quality of simulation-based forecasting. Example applications from the automotive industry show the benefits of SEWS.

#!A range of implementation strategies of DFA-based string recognizers is suggested. The strategies are associated with parameters which modify the implementation of conventional DFA implementations (table-driven and hardcoded). These parameters are used to provide a formal characterization of DFA-based string recognizers. Various instantiations of these parameters correspond to various DFA-based string processing algorithms. The algorithms derived are further classified, based on the refinement of some of them, resulting in a taxonomy tree. The tree will form the basis for further studies on the design and implementation of DFA-based string processors.

Every chapter of this book contains excellent explanations and insights into the smaller but important decisions we continuously have to make when creating quality code and classes.”ï¾Erich Gamma, IBM Distinguished Engineer“Many teams have a master developer who makes a rapid stream of good decisions all day long. Their code is easy to understand, quick to modify, and feels safe and comfortable to work with. If you ask how they thought to write something the way they did, they always have a good reason. This book will help you become the master developer on your team. The breadth and depth of topics will engage veteran programmers, who will pick up new tricks and improve on old habits, while the clarity makes it accessible to even novice developers.”ï¾Russ Rufer, Silicon Valley Patterns Group“Many people don't realize how readable code can be and how valuable that readability is. Kent has taught me so much, I'm glad this book gives everyone the chance to learn from him.”ï¾Martin Fowler, chief scientist, ThoughtWorks“Code should be worth reading, not just by the compiler, but by humans. Kent Beck distilled his experience into a cohesive collection of implementation patterns. These nuggets of advice will make your code truly worth reading.”ï¾Gregor Hohpe, author of Enterprise Integration Patterns“In this book Kent Beck shows how writing clear and readable code follows from the application of simple principles. Implementation Patterns will help developers write intention revealing code that is both easy to understand and flexible towards future extensions. A must read for developers who are serious about their code.”ï¾Sven Gorts“Implementation Patterns bridges the gap between design and coding. Beck introduces a new way of thinking about programming by basing his discussion on values and principles.”ï¾Diomidis Spinellis, author of Code Reading and Code QualitySoftware Expert Kent Beck Presents a Catalog of Patterns Infinitely Useful for Everyday ProgrammingGreat code doesn't just function: it clearly and consistently communicates your intentions, allowing other programmers to understand your code, rely on it, and modify it with confidence. But great code doesn't just happen. It is the outcome of hundreds of small but critical decisions programmers make every single day. Now, legendary software innovator Kent Beckï¾known worldwide for creating Extreme Programming and pioneering software patterns and test-driven developmentï¾focuses on these critical decisions, unearthing powerful “implementation patterns” for writing programs that are simpler, clearer, better organized, and more cost effective.Beck collects 77 patterns for handling everyday programming tasks and writing more readable code. This new collection of patterns addresses many aspects of development, including class, state, behavior, method, collections, frameworks, and more. He uses diagrams, stories, examples, and essays to engage the reader as he illuminates the patterns. You'll find proven solutions for handling everything from naming variables to checking exceptions.This book covers The value of communicating through code and the philosophy behind patterns How and when to create classes, and how classes encode logic Best practices for storing and retrieving state Behavior: patterns for representing logic, including alternative paths Writing, naming, and decomposing methods Choosing and using collections Implementation pattern variations for use in building frameworks Implementation Patterns will help programmers at all experience levels, especially those who have benefited from software patterns or agile methods. It will also be an indispensable resource for development teams seeking to work together more efficiently and build more maintainable software. No other programming book will touch your day-to-day work more often.

#!The dynamic, non-linear, and complex nature of a supply chain with numerous interactions among its entities are best evaluated using simulation models. The optimization of such system is not amenable to mathematical programming approaches. The simulation-optimization method seems to be the most promising. In this paper, we look at a refinery supply chain simulation and attempt to optimize the refinery operating policies and capacity investments by employing a genetic algorithm. The refinery supply chain is complex with multiple, distributed, and disparate entities which operate their functions based on certain policies. Policy and investment decisions have significant impact on the refinery bottom line. To optimize them, we develop a simple simulation-optimization framework by combining the refinery supply chain simulator called Integrated Refinery In Silico (IRIS) and genetic algorithm. Results indicate that the proposed framework works well for optimization of supply chain policy and investment decisions.

#!The advances in 3D data acquisition techniques, graphics hardware, and 3D data modeling and visualizing techniques have led to the proliferation of 3D models. This has made the searching for specific 3D models a vital issue. Techniques for effective and efficient content-based retrieval of 3D models have therefore become an essential research topic. In this paper, a novel feature, called elevation descriptor, is proposed for 3D model retrieval. The elevation descriptor is invariant to translation and scaling of 3D models and it is robust for rotation. First, six elevations are obtained to describe the altitude information of a 3D model from six different views. Each elevation is represented by a gray-level image which is decomposed into several concentric circles. The elevation descriptor is obtained by taking the difference between the altitude sums of two successive concentric circles. An efficient similarity matching method is used to find the best match for an input model. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other descriptors, including spherical harmonics, the MPEG-7 3D shape spectrum descriptor, and D2.

#!The ModelCamera is a system for inside-looking-out modeling of static, room-size indoor scenes. The ModelCamera implements an interactive modeling pipeline based on real-time dense color and sparse depth. The operator scans the scene with a device that acquires a video stream augmented with 49 depth samples per frame. The system registers the frames using the depth and color data, and integrates them into an evolving model that is displayed continually. The operator selects views by checking the display for missing or undersampled surfaces and aiming the camera at them. A model is built from thousands of frames.

#!The simulation system JAMES II is aimed at supporting a range of modeling formalisms and simulation engines. The partitioning of models is essential for distributed simulation. A suitable partition depends on model, hardware, and simulation algorithm characteristics. Therefore, a partitioning layer has been created in JAMES II which allows to plug in partitioning algorithms on demand. Three different partitioning algorithms have been implemented. In addition to the well known Kernighan-Lin algorithm and a geometric approach, a partitioning algorithm for hierarchically structured models has been developed whose performance is evaluated.

#!This paper presents an active contour model for extracting accurate facial regions in complex environments. In the model, a contour is represented by a zero level set of level function @f, and evolved via level set partial differential equations. Then, unlike general active contours, skin-color information that is represented by 2D-Gaussian model is used for evolving and stopping a curve, which allows the proposed method to be robust to noise and varying pose. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, it was tested with several natural scenes, and the results were compared with those of geodesic active contours. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

However, controlvariate estimators require more computational effort than sample means, and effective controls must be identified. We present a new CV screening procedure to avoid much of the computation cost. We also present a two-stage CV combined procedure which captures the ability to eliminate inferior systems in the first stage and the statistical efficiency of control variates for selection in the second stage. An empirical evaluation is provided.

#!Knowledge management (KM) and knowledge management systems (KMS) have been positioned as strategies and tools that enable organizations to create and transfer knowledge in order to sustain competitive advantage. While KM as a strategy gained legitimacy, KMS have struggled to show a causal relationship to knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. KMS contribution to the economic performance of organizations has been harder to prove, mainly because of a lack of collection of data and thus analysis of knowledge metrics. This has lead to an unjustifiable move to underplay the role of technology in creating and transferring knowledge. We strived to revive interest in KMS by exploring their ability to accumulate social capital and showing its effect on the creation and transfer of knowledge. We posited that social capital was the mediating factor between KMS and knowledge creation and transfer and hypothesized that: (1) KMS will positively affect an organization's ability to build social capital, and that (2) social capital will enhance a firm's ability to create and transfer knowledge. Qualitative data collected from a multinational IT consulting firm was used to validate the framework.

#!In this paper, we investigate the influence of several machine criticality measures on the performance of a shifting bottleneck heuristic for complex job shops. The shifting bottleneck heuristic is a decomposition approach that tackles the overall scheduling problem by solving a sequence of tool group scheduling problems and composes the overall solution by using a disjunctive graph. Machine criticality measures are responsible for the sequence of the considered tool group scheduling problems. We suggest a new machine criticality measure that is a weighted sum of several existing criticality measures. It turns out that the shifting bottleneck heuristic performs well compared to dispatching rules when the suggested criticality measure is used. We present the results of computational experiments.

#!Adobe Photoshop has become the tool of choice for professional photographers, designers, and amateur enthusiasts. But it's a complex application with many features-and scant information on how to use them to best advantage. A case in point: there are 100 built-in filters in Photoshop, designed to enable the user to easily make subtle or dramatic image adjustments, and there is very little online help available with the application, and no printed manual. Users can spend hours trying to use filters effectively-an inefficient and often frustrating way to work. In Photoshop Filter Effects Encyclopedia, author and educator Roger Pring explains and decodes the settings of every filter that Photoshop CS2 has to offer, from Artistic filters such as Colored Pencil, Cutout, and Watercolor to Stylize filters like Bevel, Emboss, and Extrude. And, unlike many reference books that give you a lot of information you'll never need, it is filled with easy-to-follow, step-by-step, practical recipes for creating truly amazing effects, such as: Creating selective focus Simulating motion blur Adding special lens and filter effects Working with tone and color Creating dramatic solarized and posterized images Working with artificial lighting Simulating textures Creating multi-layered images and photomontages Reproducing graphic arts effects and much more. The best part is that you don't have to be a Photoshop expert to create sophisticated, professional-looking results-the recipes take the guesswork out of the process, so you can work quickly and efficiently. Packed with hundreds of full-color photographs, clearly written instructions, and practical tips, this book is the ultimate, no-nonsense Photoshop CS2 Filters reference for creative photographers, designers, and artists.

#!Parallel programs for distributed memory machines are not easy to create and maintain, especially when they involve sparse matrix computations. In this paper, we propose a program translation system for generating parallel sparse matrix computation codes utilizing PSBLAS. The purpose of the development of the system is to offer the user a convenient way to construct parallel sparse code based on PSBLAS. The system is build up on the idea of bridging the gap between the easy-to-read program representations and highly-tuned parallel executables based on existing parallel sparse matrix computation libraries. The system accepts a MATLAB program with annotations and generates subroutines for an SPMD-style parallel program which runs on distributed-memory machines. Experimental results on parallel machines show that the prototype of our system can generate fairly efficient PSBLAS codes for simple applications such as CG and Bi-CGSTAB programs.

#!In this paper, a new eye detection method is presented. The method consists of three steps: (1) extraction of binary edge images (BEIs) from the grayscale face image based on multi-resolution wavelet transform, (2) extraction of eye regions and segments from BEIs and (3) eye localization based on light dots and intensity information. In the paper, an improved face region extraction algorithm and a light dots detection algorithm are proposed for better eye detection performance. Also a multi-level eye detection scheme is adopted. Experimental results show that a correct eye detection rate of 98.7% can be achieved on 150 Bern images with variations in views and gaze directions and 96.6% can be achieved on 564 AR images with different facial expressions and lighting conditions.

#!Supply chain transformation is an emerging service area in the market which aims at helping clients improve their operational efficiency and reduce costs. As a generic technique for the analysis of complex and dynamic systems, simulation could play an important role in this field. This paper presents a case study showing how simulation could be the key enablement for a supply chain transformation project. A methodology and tool developed by IBM China Research Lab has been applied in this joint project with a world-class supplier of home improvement tools. By applying simulation, the client is provided an insightful view about their business processes and inventory allocation strategy, which serves as the basis for the transformation implementation. Financial results show that simulation has addressed the key issues and provided the client accountable evaluation results for decision-making.

#!The digital factory concept offers an integrated approach to enhance the product and production engineering processes and simulation is a key technology within this concept. Different types of simulation, such as discrete event or 3D-motion simulation can be applied in virtual models on various planning levels and stages to improve the product and process planning on all levels. The focus and key factor is the integration of the various planning and simulation processes. In an advanced stage simulation technology can be applied in the digital factory concept to enhance the operative production planning and control as an integrated process from the top level to the factory floor control.

#!We present a general-purpose numerical scheme for time integration of Lagrangian dynamical systems---an important computational tool at the core of most physics-based animation techniques. Several features make this particular time integrator highly desirable for computer animation: it numerically preserves important invariants, such as linear and angular momenta; the symplectic nature of the integrator also guarantees a correct energy behavior, even when dissipation and external forces are added; holonomic constraints can also be enforced quite simply; finally, our simple methodology allows for the design of high-order accurate schemes if needed. Two key properties set the method apart from earlier approaches. First, the nonlinear equations that must be solved during an update step are replaced by a minimization of a novel functional, speeding up time stepping by more than a factor of two in practice. Second, the formulation introduces additional variables that provide key flexibility in the implementation of the method. These properties are achieved using a discrete form of a general variational principle called the Pontryagin-Hamilton principle, expressing time integration in a geometric manner. We demonstrate the applicability of our integrators to the simulation of non-linear elasticity with implementation details.

#!Chip design in the nanometer regime is becoming increasingly difficult due to process variations. ASIC designers have adopted statistical optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of variations. The FPGA community on the other hand, has only recently started focussing on the effects of variations. This paper presents a comparative study of the impact of variations on designs mapped to FPGAs and ASICs to get a measure of the severity of the problem in both the FPGA and ASIC domains. We also propose a variation aware router that reduces the yield loss by 7.61X, or the circuit delay by 3.95% for the same yield for the MCNC benchmarks.

#!In this paper, a novel algorithm for finding k points that are closest to a query point is presented. Some inequalities are used to delete impossible data points and reduce distance computations. Our algorithm makes use of a data point's feature to reject unlikely candidates for a query point and can eliminate many of the unlikely data points, which cannot be rejected by other available algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm is superior to other methods in terms of computing time and the number of distance calculations in most cases and is more remarkable, if a larger data set with higher dimension is used. Compared with available approaches, our method can reduce the computing time and number of distance calculations significantly.

#!Research on computer programming usually views the interactions as mostly cognitively based, with focus on concepts such as memory, perception and conceptual understanding. However, the current trend towards embodied and social perspectives on interaction provides an alternative way of looking at interactive processes, instead emphasising aspects such as social and physical performance with and around technology. We have explored a range of activities and tools that explicitly address these aspects in programming, with a specific focus on children's making of own computer games and simulations. We exemplify this work through three different situations where tools and activities are used by children as recourses for building of interactive systems, while at the same time allowing for bodily action in negotiation of design ideas. We discuss how situations like these may provide directions for new technologies for programming as well as methodological developments in the area of interaction design.

#!On the heterogeneous web information spaces, users have been suffering from efficiently searching for relevant information. This paper proposes a mediator agent system to estimate the semantics of unknown web spaces by learning the fragments gathered during the users' focused crawling. This process is organized as the following three tasks; (i) gathering semantic information about web spaces from personal agents while focused crawling in unknown spaces, (ii) reorganizing the information by using ontology alignment algorithm, and (iii) providing relevant semantic information to personal agents right before focused crawling. It makes the personal agent possible to recognize the corresponding user's behaviors in semantically heterogeneous spaces and predict his searching contexts. For the experiments, we implemented comparison-shopping system with heterogeneous web spaces. As a result, our proposed method efficiently supported the users, and then, network traffic was also reduced.

#!It has been shown that as long as traffic sources adapt their rates to aggregate congestion measure in their paths, they implicitly maximize certain utility. In this paper we study some counter-intuitive throughput behaviors in such networks, pertaining to whether a fair allocation is always inefficient and whether increasing capacity always raises aggregate throughput. A bandwidth allocation policy can be defined in terms of a class of utility functions parameterized by a scalar α that can be interpreted as a quantitative measure of fairness. An allocation is fair if α is large and efficient if aggregate throughput is large. All examples in the literature suggest that a fair allocation is necessarily inefficient. We characterize exactly the tradeoff between fairness and throughput in general networks. The characterization allows us both to produce the first counter-example and trivially explain all the previous supporting examples. Surprisingly, our counter-example has the property that a fairer allocation is always more efficient. In particular it implies that maxmin fairness can achieve a higher throughput than proportional fairness. Intuitively, we might expect that increasing link capacities always raises aggregate throughput. We show that not only can throughput be reduced when some link increases its capacity, more strikingly, it can also be reduced when all links increase their capacities by the same amount. If all links increase their capacities proportionally, however, throughput will indeed increase. These examples demonstrate the intricate interactions among sources in a network setting that are missing in a single-link topology.

#!This work studies three variants of a three-machine flowshop problem with two operations per job to minimize make-span (F3/o = 2/Cmax). A set of n jobs are classified into three mutually exclusive families A,B and C. The familiesA,B and C are defined as the set of jobs that is scheduled in machine sequence (M1, M2), (M1, M3) and (M1, M3), respectively, where (Mx, My) specifies the machine sequence for the job that is processed first on Mx, and then on My. Specifically, jobs with the same route (machine sequence) are classified into the same family. Three variants of F3/o = 2/Cmax are studied. First, F3/ GT, no-idle, o = 2/Cmax, in which both machine no-idle and GT restrictions are considered. The GT assumption requires that all jobs in the same family are processed contiguously on the machine and the machine no-idle assumption requires that all machines work continuously without idle time. Second, the problem F3/GT, o = 2/Cmax, in which the machine no-idle restriction in the first variant is relaxed, is considered. Third, the problem F3/no-idle, o = 2/Cmax with the GT assumption in the first variant relaxed is considered. Based on the dominance conditions developed, the optimal solution is polynomially derived for each variant. These results may narrow down the gap between easy and hard cases of the general problem.

As the most popular photo-editing program on the market, Photoshop Elements not only has Photoshop's marvelous powers, but also has capabilities the mothership lacks. Each new version includes more tools designed specifically for today's consumer digital photo enthusiasts. The latest edition, Photoshop Elements 5, solidifies the reputation of this superb and inexpensive product with new scrapbook features, a link to online photo services, and many other improvements. In fact, there's so much to Photoshop Elements that it can be quite confusing at times. That's precisely why our Missing Manuals are the bestselling books on the topic. Adobe provides a pamphlet and some help files; our book, now in its fifth edition, carefully explains every feature the program has to offer (something no other book has done) by putting each one into a clear, easy-to-understand context. Photoshop Elements 5: The Missing Manual covers the Windows version of Adobe's workhorse and gives you the low down on a host of new features:Learn to create multiple page documents, custom photo layouts with frames, and highly customized layouts for scrapbook projectsMaster the new editor for Layer Styles, which lets you customize individual layers in a photo"Attach" your photos to areas of a Yahoo! Map so your friends and family can see the pictures you took in specific placesAuthor Barbara Brundage also introduces you to a new sophisticated tool called "Curves" to adjust the color and contrast in your photos, and shows you how to burn multi-session CDs and DVDs. As always, she lets you know which features work well, which don't, and why -- all with a bit of wit and good humor. Although the book progresses from simple to complex tasks, you can easily jump around to learn specific techniques, such as creating photomontages (composites), restoring old photos, preparing images for the Web, and archiving. More than a dozen downloadable images let you practice using the editing tools right away!

The shortest loop design problem is to find the shortest loop for an automated guided vehicle covering at least one edge of each department of a block layout. In this paper, first it is shown that this problem can be represented as a graph model. The properties of the presented model enable us to design a meta-heuristic based on ant colony system algorithm for solving the shortest loop design problem. Computational results show the efficiency of our algorithm in compare to the other techniques.

#!Today's macromolecular regulatory network models are small compared to the amount of information known about a particular cellular pathway, in part because current modeling languages and tools are unable to handle significantly larger models. Thus, most pathway modeling work today focuses on building small models of individual pathways since they are easy to construct and manage. The hope is someday to put these pieces together to create a more complete picture of the underlying molecular machinery. While efforts to make large models benefit from reusing existing components, unfortunately, there currently exists little tool or representational support for combining or composing models. We have identified four distinct modeling processes related to model composition: fusion, composition, aggregation, and flattening. We present concrete proposals for implementing all four processes in the context of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).

#!Restoring data operations after a disaster is a daunting task: how should recovery be performed to minimize data loss and application downtime? Administrators are under considerable pressure to recover quickly, so they lack time to make good scheduling decisions. They schedule recovery based on rules of thumb, or on pre-determined orders that might not be best for the failure occurrence. With multiple workloads and recovery techniques, the number of possibilities is large, so the decision process is not trivial.This paper makes several contributions to the area of data recovery scheduling. First, we formalize the description of potential recovery processes by defining recovery graphs. Recovery graphs explicitly capture alternative approaches for recovering workloads, including their recovery tasks, operational states, timing information and precedence relationships. Second, we formulate the data recovery scheduling problem as an optimization problem, where the goal is to find the schedule that minimizes the financial penalties due to downtime, data loss and vulnerability to subsequent failures. Third, we present several methods for finding optimal or near-optimal solutions, including priority-based, randomized and genetic algorithm-guided ad hoc heuristics. We quantitatively evaluate these methods using realistic storage system designs and workloads, and compare the quality of the algorithms' solutions to optimal solutions provided by a math programming formulation and to the solutions from a simple heuristic that emulates the choices made by human administrators. We find that our heuristics' solutions improve on the administrator heuristic's solutions, often approaching or achieving optimality.

#!Discrete event models are systems where components interact via timed events. Although there are many languages and simulators with discrete-event semantics (VHDL, OpNet Modeler, ns2, etc.), there is not widespread agreement on the precise semantics. This talk examines a formal foundation for discrete-event systems that clarifies interesting corner cases, where events are simultaneous, ordered or unordered, and where Zeno conditions arise. It introduces analytical tools for studying such cases, lends insight into parallel and distributed execution of discrete-event models, and suggests a unified semantics that is efficient and clean.

#!The IBM System i family, with its operating system IBM i5/OS, is considered one of the most secure systems in the industry. From the beginning, security was designed as an integral part of the system. The System i platform provides a rich set of security features and services that pertain to the goals of authentication, authorization, integrity, confidentiality, and auditing. However, if an IBM Client does not know that a service, such as a virtual private network (VPN) or hardware cryptographic support, exists on the system, they will not use it. In addition, there are more and more security auditors and consultants who are in charge of implementing corporate security policies in an organization. In many cases, they are not familiar with the System i platform, but need to understand the security services that are available. This IBM Redbook guides you through the native security features that are available on the System i platform. This book is intended for security auditors and consultants, IBM System Specialists, Business Partners, and Clients to help you answer first-level questions concerning the security features that are available on the System i platform.

#!In this experience report, we present experiences we have gained in applying performance engineering techniques during the design of a DVB-H enabled handheld device. The modelling methodology we applied uses UML 2.0 to model the system following a strict separation of architectural and behavioural aspects of the systems. From sequence diagrams and composite structure diagrams, a queueing network is generated for the analysis of the system performance. The configuration of the hardware resources and the resource demands is done using the standard SPT-profile. We describe our implementation and its seamless integration into a UML 2.0 CASE tool. Finally, the paper outlines lessons learnt during the design process which may be used to enhance the methodology.

#!The growing acceptance of user-microprogrammable computers indicates that microprogramming, as a discipline, will require development of user-oriented microprogramming support. A number of approaches (definition of sophisticated target machines, microcode assemblers, and higher level microprogramming languages) have been proposed. The issues involved in choosing support tools include the range of proposed applications, hardware parallelism (horizental or minimally encoded control vs. vertically encoded control) and constraints on performance. After reviewing some of these tradeoffs, design considerations for higher level microprogramming languages are considered. One of the most important design decisions is fixing the level of the language, defined on a continuum from symbolic assemblers, through general purpose programming languages such as PL/I. A tailored language concept is defined and illustrated, using as an example a microprogramming language for a horizontally encoded microprogrammable computer currently under development.

#!A large body of traditional animation exists that contains characters with poses, expressions, and appeal not easily achievable with modern 3D techniques. To create new uses for this body of animation, this paper presents components of a system that can help incorporate the animation into re-usable libraries. In particular, we discuss two semi-automatic techniques that allow the re-use of traditional animation. First, support vector machines are used to segment cartoon images from their backgrounds for incorporation into an image library, for such applications as re-sequencing. Second, a radial basis function implicit surface modeling technique and a fast non-rigid elastic registration algorithm provide inbetween contours and textures given two key images of traditional animation. Our system is fast, model-free, and requires minimal animator intervention.

#@Mei-Po Kwan,Irene Casas

#index3823
#!A series of travel simulators have been developed in the past two decades under the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) umbrella. They have addressed issues such as reactions to advisory radio and variable message signs, use of navigation systems, route diversion, and mode choice. The objective of this paper is to present the design and implementation of a different kind of travel simulator. GABRIEL (Gis Activity-Based tRavel sImuLator) has as a foundation the activity-based approach and makes use of geographic information systems (GIS) as a development environment. The simulation scenario consists of a commute trip where two activities take place. En-route to the first destination, congestion occurs and subjects are requested to take action based on a set of alternatives. The simulator provides re-routing, destination substitution, dynamic geographic information and real-time information to aid users in their decision-making process. As a result it helps subjects in developing their ability to adapt given a particular scenario and allow researchers in understanding trip making, activity rescheduling, and the decision-making process from a comprehensive perspective.

#!The coexistence of MPEG-2 and its powerful successor H.264/AVC has created a huge need for MPEG-2/H.264 video transcoding. However, a traditional transcoder where an MPEG-2 decoder is simply cascaded to an H.264 encoder requires huge computational power due to the adoption of a complicated rate-distortion based mode decision process in H.264. This paper proposes a 2-D Sobel filter based motion vector domain method and a DCT domain method to measure macroblock complexity and realize content-based H.264 candidate mode decision. A new local edge based fast INTRA prediction mode decision method is also adopted to boost the encoding efficiency. Simulation results confirm that with the proposed methods the computational burden of a traditional transcoder can be reduced by 20% ∼ 30% with only a negligible bit-rate increase for a wide range of video sequences.

#!There have been many debates on how to design the human-computer interface (HCI). Often, one can find that different views in a debate are simply because these views are attached to different aspects which embody the same thing. In other words, prior to giving an effective judgment of a debate, one needs to establish an understanding of the 'total' aspects of a thing the debate is about. Following this line of thinking, in this paper, we propose an understanding of the 'total' aspects of designing HCI, which is called the total interface design framework. We then judge several debates under this framework with the purpose of exemplifying the judgment process for any other debate related to designing HCI. At the end, the debates used for exemplifying our judgment process can be resolved. The effectiveness of the total interface design framework for integrating the different HCI approaches is also demonstrated.

In the paper of Williams [1] five different types of problems are considered and each is formulated in two different ways. The first of these problems will be considered here, a Market Share problem, and this will be formulated in two additional ways. The two additional formulations are in fact general methods of formulating certain types of problems in (0-1) variables and so can be used on other models.

#!In this paper we study the complexity-theoretic aspects of mining maximal frequent patterns, from the perspective of counting the number of all distinct solutions. We present the first formal proof that the problem of counting the number of maximal frequent itemsets in a database of transactions, given an arbitrary support threshold, is #P-complete, thereby providing theoretical evidence that the problem of mining maximal frequent itemsets is NP-hard. We also extend our complexity analysis to other similar data mining problems that deal with complex data structures, such as sequences, trees, and graphs. We investigate several variants of these mining problems in which the patterns of interest are subsequences, subtrees, or subgraphs, and show that the associated problems of counting the number of maximal frequent patterns are all either #P-complete or #P-hard.

#!Nearly ten years after its first presentation and five years after its first application to operating systems, the suitability of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for the development of operating system kernels is still highly in dispute. While the AOP advocacy emphasizes the benefits of AOP towards better configurability and maintainability of system software, most kernel developers express a sound skepticism regarding the thereby induced runtime and memory costs: Operating system kernels have to be lean and efficient.We have analyzed the runtime and memory costs of aspects in general, on the level of &mu;-benchmarks, and by refactoring and extending the eCos operating system kernel using AspectC++, an AOP extension to the C++ language. Our results show that most AOP features do not induce a intrinsic overhead and that the actual overhead induced by AspectC++ is very low. We have also analyzed a test case with significant aspect-related costs. This example shows how the structure of the underlying kernel can have a negative impact on aspect implementations and how these costs can be avoided by an aspect-aware design.Based on this analysis, our conclusion is that AOP is suitable for the development of operating system kernels and other kinds of highly efficient infrastructure software.

#!Since 1970 we have been jointly working with systems analysts in order to develop new techniques which are computationally efficient for solving network problems. Our first step in this direction was to elaborate on Johnson's "triple-label method" [9] by providing a method for characterizing successive basis trees with minimal relabeling. This procedure, which is called the augmented predecessor index (API) method [5], additionally indicates the most efficient way to co-ordinate the activities of finding the representation of the come-in arc (basis equivalent path), pricing-out the basis, and updating the basis labels. The API method has been a major contributor to the improvements in the computational efficiency of solution algorithms. Its use was a factor underlying the efficiency attained by the special purpose primal simplex transportation code of Glover, Karney, and Klingman [6]. In addition, the procedure was incorporated into the Srinivasan -- Thompson accelerated primal transportation code [14] and succeeded in cutting the solution times of that algorithm by more than half.

#!At the NATO conference on Large Scale Decomposition in Cambridge, England, July 1972, it appeared to me that few people knew how matrix inversion is really done in standard MP systems with product form. So I concocted an example and used part of my talk time to run through it. Several people appreciated this and Mike Grigoridis suggested I should put it in the Newsletter. He also wanted it for his own use. My apology to him for the long delay in organizing and typing it, but here it is. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!The first-order theorem prover SCOTT has been through a series of versions over some ten years. The successive provers, while retaining the same underlying technology, have used radically different algorithms and shown wide differences of behaviour. The development process has depended heavily on experiments with problems from the TPTP library and has been sharpened by participation in CASC each year since 1997. In the present paper, we outline some of the difficulties inherent in designing and refining a theorem prover as complex as SCOTT, and explain our experimental methodology. While SCOTT is not one of the systems which have been highly optimised for CASC, it does help to illustrate the influence of both CASC and the TPTP library on contemporary theorem proving research.

#!In this paper we present an empirical study of a workload gathered by crawling the eDonkey network --- a dominant peer-to-peer file sharing system --- for over 50 days.We first confirm the presence of some known features, in particular the prevalence of free-riding and the Zipf-like distribution of file popularity. We also analyze the evolution of document popularity.We then provide an in-depth analysis of several clustering properties of such workloads. We measure the geographical clustering of peers offering a given file. We find that most files are offered mostly by peers of a single country, although popular files don't have such a clear home country.We then analyze the overlap between contents offered by different peers. We find that peer contents are highly clustered according to several metrics of interest.We propose to leverage this property by allowing peers to search for content without server support, by querying suitably identified semantic neighbours. We find via trace-driven simulations that this approach is generally effective, and is even more effective for rare files. If we further allow peers to query both their semantic neighbours, and in turn their neighbours' neighbours, we attain hit rates as high as over 55% for neighbour lists of size 20.

#!The purpose of this paper is twofold. First we introduce improved versions of our algorithms for refining and coarsening 2D and 3D nested triangular and tetrahedral grids, and secondly the application of these algorithms in the simulation of 2D and 3D problems, is demonstrated. A key idea of the algorithms is the use of the topological concept of the skeleton of a triangulation in two or three dimensions in order to reduce the dimension of the refinement problem in a natural hierarchic manner.Improved skeleton based refinement (SBR) algorithms and their counterpart, the skeleton based derefinement (SBD) algorithms are described in this study. The algorithms are fully automatic and are applied here to a 2D boundary value problem, a 3D approximation problem with a large gradient, a geometric shape modeling problem and a simulation evolution problem in 3D.

#!In this paper we propose a geometry-based image retrieval scheme that makes use of projectively invariant features. Cross-ratio (CR) is an invariant feature under projective transformations for collinear points. We compute the CRs of point sets in quadruplets and the CR histogram is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. Being a geometric feature, it allows us to retrieve similar images irrespective of view point and illumination changes. We can retrieve the same building even if the facade has undergone a fresh coat of paints! Color and textural features can also be included, if desired. Experimental results show a favorably very good retrieval accuracy when tested on an image database of size 4000. The method is very effective in retrieving images having man-made objects rich in polygonal structures like buildings, rail tracks, etc.

#!Concurrent multipath transfer (CMT) uses the Stream Control Transmission Protocol's (SCTP) multihoming feature to distribute data across multiple end-to-end paths in a multihomed SCTP association. We identify three negative side-effects of reordering introduced by CMT that must be managed before efficient parallel transfer can be achieved: (1) unnecessary fast retransmissions by a sender; (2) overly conservative congestion window (cwnd) growth at a sender; and (3) increased ack traffic due to fewer delayed acks by a receiver. We propose three algorithms which augment and/or modify current SCTP to counter these side-effects. Presented with several choices as to where a sender should direct retransmissions of lost data, we propose five retransmission policies for CMT. We demonstrate spurious retransmissions in CMT with all five policies and propose changes to CMT to allow the different policies. CMT is evaluated against AppStripe, which is an idealized application that stripes data over multiple paths using multiple SCTP associations. The different CMT retransmission policies are then evaluated with varied constrained receive buffer sizes. In this foundation work, we operate under the strong assumption that the bottleneck queues on the end-to-end paths used in CMT are independent.

#!Gas chromatography (GC) is one of the most widespread techniques used in laboratories as a way to separate and analyze complex mixtures of volatile and semi-volatile compounds. The main advantage of miniaturization of these systems is the increased performance due to the reduced time for analysis and reduced fabrication cost of the complex pneumatic flow system. In this paper advanced design ideas and fabrication processes to facilitate integration of the sample concentrator and the column will be presented. Using the LIGA process, 0.5- and 2-m-long, 50-&#x03bc;m-wide, and up to 600-&#x03bc;m-high aspect ratio metal GC separation columns with on-chip integrated sample injection and detection were fabricated. Initial experiments of coating these high aspect ratio columns show promising results when compared to simple tubular columns.

#!In this paper, we present the first nontrivial theoretical bound on the quality of the 3D solids generated by any contour interpolation method. Given two arbitrary parallel contour slices with n vertices in 3D, let &alpha; be the smallest angle in the constrained Delaunay triangulation of the corresponding 2D contour overlay, we present a contour interpolation method which reconstructs a 3D solid with the minimum dihedral angle of at least &alpha;/8. Our algorithm runs in O(nlogn) time where n is the size of the contour overlay.We also present a heuristic algorithm that optimizes the dihedral angles of a mesh representing a surface in 3D.

#!The objective in the creation of domain specific discrete event simulation environments is to facilitate model development in the chosen domain. In the creation of such environments, there has been a tendency to adopt a factory based world view. In this paper, we describe an approach to the creation of a generic modeling environment in the healthcare domain that breaks away from the conventional entity driven request for resource. Our approach has enabled us to create models of emergency care in four UK NHS hospitals that reflect more realistically the way emergency care is actually delivered. It appears, paradoxically, that in simulating emergency care, it is best if the patient does not come first.

We prove that under certain conditions the temporal convergence order of the fully discrete scheme depends on the time index of the partial differential-algebraic equation. In particular, fractional orders of convergence in time are encountered. Furthermore we show that the fully discrete scheme suffers an order reduction caused by the boundary conditions. Numerical examples confirm the theoretical results.

#!A novel method, entitled the discrete global descent method, is developed in this paper to solve discrete global optimization problems and nonlinear integer programming problems. This method moves from one discrete minimizer of the objective function f to another better one at each iteration with the help of an auxiliary function, entitled the discrete global descent function. The discrete global descent function guarantees that its discrete minimizers coincide with the better discrete minimizers of f under some standard assumptions. This property also ensures that a better discrete minimizer of f can be found by some classical local search methods. Numerical experiments on several test problems with up to 100 integer variables and up to 1.38 × 10104 feasible points have demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method.

The coverage of both Agile processes and Open Source Software has been considerably expanded. In addition, the Osbert Oglesby running case study has been replaced with a new case study on the Martha Stockton Greengage Foundation. The new study highlights even more aspects of the Unified Process. The book’s unique organization remains in place, with Part I covering underlying software engineering theory, and Part II presenting the more practical life cycle. Complementing this well-balanced approach is the straightforward, student-friendly writing style, through which difficult concepts are presented in a clear, understandable manner.

The proposed approach of contextual reasoning is illustrated by sketching how two first order logics can be accommodated to the contextual framework. Some concepts such as kernel and imported part of contexts are defined, reflecting the distinction between the &ldquo;self&dash;generated&rdquo; and the communicated facts and providing a ground for defining a particular subclass of importing contexts. In order to support a larger &ldquo;repertoire&rdquo; of contexts a set of operators for combining contexts into compound structures is introduced, thus defining an algebra of contexts. The notion of compound context reflects the intuition that depending on the problem, interaction between contexts involves variety of dynamic context formations.

#!This paper proposes an approach to recognise human postures in video sequences, which combines a 2D approach with a 3D human model. The 3D model is a realistic articulated human model which is used to obtain reference postures to compare with test postures. Several 2D approaches using different silhouette representations are compared with each other: projections of moving pixels on the reference axis, Hu moments and skeletonisation. We are interested in a set of specific postures which are representative of typical video understanding applications. We describe results for recognition of general postures (e.g. standing) and detailed postures (e.g. standing with one arm up) in ambiguous/optimal viewpoint with good/bad segmented silhouette to show the effectiveness of our approach.

#!LIGA processes have been developed generally in the 2.5D world. We introduced techniques of 3D X-ray lithography and worm injection molding with a unscrewing release mechanism, and succeeded in the development to three dimensions of LIGA process. We called this technology 3D-LIGA process, and came to be able to fabricate the plastic molded product with a spiral microstructure. Furthermore, we succeeded in the trial production of a spiral microcoil using 3D-LIGA process and metallization technique combining flat and smooth electroplating with a leveling agent and an isotropic chemical etching. The diameter of this microcoil was 0.5&#x00a0;mm and the length was 1&#x00a0;mm. The width of the Cu coil line was 10&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m, and the pitch was 20&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m. Moreover, we measured characteristics of this microcoil as an inductor. The inductance and the quality factor at the frequency of 1&#x00a0;GHz were 91&#x00a0;nH and 5.8, respectively. This is the first time successful fabrication of an electric device with a 3D form like a spiral microcoil using the 3D-LIGA process has been achieved.

#!Boolean matching (BM) is a widely used technique in FPGA resynthesis and architecture evaluation. In this paper we present several improvements to the recently proposed SAT-based Boolean matching formulation (SAT-BM-M) [11]. The principal improvement was achieved by deriving the SAT formulation using the implicant instead of minterm representation of the function to be matched. This enables our BM formulation to create a SAT problem of size O (as opposed to O(m•2k) in the original formulation, where n is the number of inputs to the function, k is the size of the LUT, and m is the number of implicants, which is much smaller than 2 n and experimentally found to be around 3 . Using the new BM formulation, and considering 10-input functions, we can show an almost 3x run time improvement and can solve 5.6x more problems than the SAT-based BM formulation in [11]. Moreover, using this improved Boolean matching formulation, we implemented (as a proof of concept) a FPGA resynthesis tool, called RIMatch, which was able to reduce the number of LUTs produced by ZMap by 10% on the MCNC benchmarks.

#!In this study, the effects of denormalization on relational database system performance are discussed in the context of using denormalization strategies as a database design methodology for data warehouses. Four prevalent denormalization strategies have been identified and examined under various scenarios to illustrate the conditions where they are most effective. The relational algebra, query trees, and join cost function are used to examine the effect on the performance of relational systems. The guidelines and analysis provided are sufficiently general and they can be applicable to a variety of databases, in particular to data warehouse implementations, for decision support systems.

#!Motivation: The process of transcription is controlled by systems of factors which bind in specific arrangements, called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), in promoter regions. We present a discriminative learning algorithm which simultaneously learns the DNA binding site motifs as well as the logical structure and spatial aspects of CRMs. Results: Our results on yeast datasets show better predictive accuracy than a current state-of-the-art approach on the same datasets. Our results on yeast, fly and human datasets show that the inclusion of logical and spatial aspects improves the predictive accuracy of our learned models.

#!Motivation: The only algorithm guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment is the Smith--Waterman. It is also one of the slowest due to the number of computations required for the search. To speed up the algorithm, Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) instructions have been used to parallelize the algorithm at the instruction level. Results: A faster implementation of the Smith--Waterman algorithm is presented. This algorithm achieved 2--8 times performance improvement over other SIMD based Smith--Waterman implementations. On a 2.0 GHz Xeon Core 2 Duo processor, speeds of >3.0 billion cell updates/s were achieved. Availability: http://farrar.michael.googlepages.com/Smith-waterman Contact: farrar.michael@gmail.com

#*A canonic interpretive program form for measuring "ideal" HLL architectures
#@M. J. Flynn
#t1978
#cACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News
#index4024
#!Over the past several years our group has become increasingly interested in the notion of an "ideal" machine. Ideal with respect to some specified higher level language (HLL) environment. Initially, much of the focus of the work was on traditional machines: trying to identify and factor out architectural instructions and artifacts in programs from functional instructions. For example, the existence of load or store accumulator instructions in a program representation are largely architectural since they specify a movement among the storage resources of a system rather than a movement required in the original source program. We found it useful at the time to define three types of instructions:(1) <u>M-type instructions</u> or memory partition movement instructions such as the aforementioned load and store instructions. These instructions move data within the storage hierarchy.(2) <u>P-instructions</u> or procedural instructions performing operations associated with instruction sequencing: branch, compare, test, etc.(3) <u>F-instructions</u> are the functional instructions which actually transform a datum. These would include arithmetic operations as well as logical and shifting operations.

#!The aim of this paper is to construct exponential Runge-Kutta methods of collocation type and to analyze their convergence properties for linear and semilinear parabolic problems. For the analysis, an abstract Banach space framework of sectorial operators and locally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities is chosen. This framework includes interesting examples like reaction-diffusion equations. It is shown that the methods converge at least with their stage order, and that convergence of higher order (up to the classical order) occurs, if the problem has sufficient temporal and spatial smoothness. The latter, however, might require the source function to fulfil unnatural boundary conditions. Therefore, the classical order is not always obtained and an order reduction must be expected, in general.

#!This paper shows how classic inductive assertions can be used in conjunction with a formal operational semantics to prove partial correctness properties of programs. The method imposes only the proof obligations that would be produced by a verification condition generator &#x2013; but does not require the definition of a verification condition generator. All that is required is a theorem prover, a formal operational semantics, and the object program with appropriate assertions at user-selected cut points. The verification conditions are generated in the course of the theorem-proving process by straightforward symbolic evaluation of the formal operational semantics. The technique is demonstrated by proving the partial correctness of simple bytecode programs with respect to a preexisting operational model of the Java Virtual Machine.

#!Most of the work on behavior prediction in the field of Qualitative Reasoning has focused on transient behavior and responses to perturbations&semi; very little has been done regarding systems in steady state. A large class of systems, especially in the area of power systems, are designed for sinusoidal steady&dash;state operation. Thus, an understanding of the steady state behavior of electrical circuits is very important.This article presents a framework for reasoning about linear electrical circuits in sinusoidal steady state. The reasoning process relies on a constraint&dash;based model of the circuit, derived from electro&dash;magnetic theory and generated automatically from the structure of the circuit. In a linear circuit operating in steady state, all quantities are sinusoidals of the same frequency as the source. Since any sinusoidal can be expressed as the real part of a complex exponential, we use the complex form, which simplifies computations&semi; this complex form, characterized by magnitude and angle, is called a phasor. In order to capture magnitude and phase angle information in the model, all constraints operate on phasor variables.Constraint Propagation (CP) is the main inference mechanism. The CP module reasons with as much information and precision as the user provides, ranging from qualitative to quantitative. Intervals provide a general representation mechanism.The framework presented in this article has been implemented in a program called Qualitative Phasor Analysis (QPA), which performs circuit analysis, parameter design, diagnosis, control design, and structure simplification. Circuits with multiple sources are solved using the superposition principle.

#!The second and third authors and others have studied collections of (usually) convex ''tiles''-a generalization of pixels or voxels-in R^2 and R^3 that have a property called strong normality (SN): for any tile P, only finitely many tiles intersect P, and any nonempty intersection of those tiles also intersects P. This paper extends basic results about strong normality to collections of contractible polyhedra in R^n whose nonempty intersections are contractible. We also give sufficient (and trivially necessary) conditions on a locally finite collection of contractible polyhedra in R^2 or R^3 for their nonempty intersections to be contractible.

#!This paper evaluates the shop data model (SDM) being developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in terms of its viability as a neutral file format (NFF) for the discrete-event simulation (DES) of manufacturing systems. ProModel simulation software served as the test case for this evaluation. Observations are also provided regarding the challenges that simulation vendors might encounter when implementing the proposed NIST SDM. This paper shows that the NIST SDM doesn't pose any limitations which would prevent it from syntactically representing a manufacturing simulation model, however, it is not without certain challenges and difficulties. While only 28% of the ProModel data elements are currently supported by the SDM, future enhancements to the SDM should allow the information model to serve as a foundation upon which a common information model and NFF for the DES industry could be built.

#!Denial of Service attacks are presenting an increasing threat to the global inter-networking infrastructure. While TCP's congestion control algorithm is highly robust to diverse network conditions, its implicit assumption of end-system cooperation results in a well-known vulnerability to attack by high-rate non-responsive flows. In this paper, we investigate a class of low-rate denial of service attacks which, unlike high-rate attacks, are difficult for routers and counter-DoS mechanisms to detect. Using a combination of analytical modeling, simulations, and Internet experiments, we show that maliciously chosen low-rate DoS traffic patterns that exploit TCP's retransmission timeout mechanism can throttle TCP flows to a small fraction of their ideal rate while eluding detection. Moreover, as such attacks exploit protocol homogeneity, we study fundamental limits of the ability of a class of randomized timeout mechanisms to thwart such low-rate DoS attacks.

#!Simulation has become the tool of choice for an increasing number of networking researchers. Unfortunately, standard statistical techniques often cannot be applied when Internetlike heavy-tailed workloads are used as input. We present issues involved in using heavy-tailed distributions in network simulations, including three different methods for dealing with such distributions in simulation. We also discuss the proper use of the random number generator implemented in the ns-2 simulator and the impacts of improper usage.

#!All of the prototype reduction schemes (PRS) which have been reported in the literature, process time-invariant data to yield a subset of prototypes that are useful in nearest-neighbor-like classification. Although these methods have been proven to be powerful, they suffer from a major disadvantage when they are utilized for applications involving non-stationary data, namely, time varying samples, typical of video and multimedia applications. In this paper, we suggest two PRS mechanisms which, in turn, are suitable for two distinct models of non-stationarity. In the first model, the data points obtained at discrete time steps, are individually assumed to be perturbed in the feature space, because of noise in the measurements or features. As opposed to this, in the second model, we assume that, at discrete time steps, new data points are available, and that these themselves are generated due to a non-stationarity in the parameters of the feature space. In both of these cases, rather than process all the data as a whole set using a PRS, we propose that the information gleaned from a previous PRS computation be enhanced to yield the prototypes for the current data set using an LVQ-3 type ''fine tuning''. The results are, to our knowledge, the first reported PRS results for non-stationary data, and can be summarized as follows: if the system obeys the first model of non-stationarity, the improved accuracy is as high as 90.98% for artificial data ''Non_normal 2'', and as high as 97.62% for the real-life data set, ''Arrhythmia''. As opposed to this, if the system obeys the second model of non-stationarity, the improved accuracy is as high as 76.30% for the artificial data, and as high as 97.40% for this real-life data set. These are, in our opinion, very impressive, considering that the data sets are truly time-varying.

#!Quite often, a designer has to chose from several alternative ways of achieving the same end. When the number of alternatives is very large, it is useful to have an "analyser" available which will mechanically enumerate the alternatives and assign a cost to each one - finally identifying the best alternative. The author has already produced such an analyser for serial programs [1, 2]. The intention of this paper is to suggest that the approach used in this earlier work can be of relevance to the design of systems involving several processors (in particular, pipelines which are in a steady state). The analyses used are very approximate, but should be sufficient to select, from a large number of alternatives, the few alternatives which warrant detailed study (e.g. by precise simulation).

While some tools for this purpose already exist, we believe that there is a demand for making their support more flexible. In particular, there is often a need for validation of multiple sets of guidelines, repairing Web pages and providing better reports for the evaluators. In this paper, we discuss such issues and how we have addressed them in the design of MAGENTA, our new tool for supporting inspection-based evaluation of accessibility and usability guidelines.

#!Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, exploded onto the scene in the spring of 2005 and remains the hottest story among web developers. With its rich combination of technologies, Ajax provides a strong foundation for creating interactive web applications with XML or JSON-based web services by using JavaScript in the browser to process the web server response.Ajax Design Patterns shows you best practices that can dramatically improve your web development projects. It investigates how others have successfully dealt with conflicting design principles in the past and then relays that information directly to you.The patterns outlined in the book fall into four categories:Foundational technology: Examines the raw technologies required for Ajax developmentProgramming: Exposes techniques that developers have discovered to ensure their Ajax applications are maintainableFunctionality and usability: Describes the types of user interfaces you'll come across in Ajax applications, as well as the new types of functionality that Ajax makes possibleDevelopment: Explains the process being used to monitor, debug, and test Ajax applicationsAjax Design Patterns will also get you up to speed with core Ajax technologies, such as XMLHttpRequest, the DOM, and JSON. Technical discussions are followed by code examples so you can see for yourself just what is-and isn't-possible with Ajax. This handy reference will help you to produce high-quality Ajax architectures, streamline web application performance, and improve the user experience.Michael Mahemoff holds a PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Melbourne, where his thesis was "Design Reuse in Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction." He lives in London and consults on software development issues in banking, health care, and logistics."Michael Mahemoff's Ajax Design Patterns is a truly comprehensive compendium of web application design expertise, centred around but not limited to Ajax techniques. Polished nuggets of design wisdom are supported by tutorials and real-world code examples resulting in a book that serves not only as an intermediate to expert handbook but also as an extensive reference for building rich interactive web applications." --Brent Ashley, remote scripting pioneer

#!Scatter search is a population-based method that has recently been shown to yield promising outcomes for solving combinatorial and nonlinear optimization problems. Based on formulations originally proposed in 1960s for combining decision rules and problem constraints such as the surrogate constraint method, scatter search uses strategies for combining solution vectors that have proved effective in a variety of problem settings. In this paper, we develop a general purpose heuristic for a class of nonlinear optimization problems. The procedure is based on the scatter search methodology and treats the objective function evaluation as a black box, making the search algorithm context-independent. Most optimization problems in the chemical and bio-chemical industries are highly nonlinear in either the objective function or the constraints. Moreover, they usually present differential-algebraic systems of constraints. In this type of problem, the evaluation of a solution or even the feasibility test of a set of values for the decision variables is a time-consuming operation. In this context, the solution method is limited to a reduced number of solution examinations. We have implemented a scatter search procedure in Matlab (Mathworks, 2004) for this special class of difficult optimization problems. Our development goes beyond a simple exercise of applying scatter search to this class of problems, but presents innovative mechanisms to obtain a good balance between intensification and diversification in a short-term search horizon. Computational comparisons with other recent methods over a set of benchmark problems favor the proposed procedure.

#!There have been many studies of auditory scene analysis in which an attempt was made to understand external events through acoustic signals. In particular, when the target is limited to music, there have been several studies aiming at automatic music scoring. In most previous studies, however, the procedure is constantly limited to local processing. Even if the procedure continues along the time axis, it is confined to the local neighborhood on the time axis, and only limited processing performance is realized. The purpose of this paper is to improve this aspect. A method is proposed which focuses on the hierarchical structure in the perception of the acoustic stream and extracts a single note string corresponding to each part from the music. In the proposed method, phrases are formed as an intermediate step in extracting the parts. Local clues are used in forming the phrases, and global clues are used in forming the parts. By using this approach, the parts are successfully extracted without problems such as explosion of the computational complexity. In a preliminary experiment, the parts were successfully extracted with a reproduction rate of approximately 80&percnt; and a fit rate of approximately 85&percnt;. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!We present a user-centered model for porting natural language interfaces (NLIs) between domains efficiently. The model assumes that domain experts without any background knowledge about computational linguistics will perform the customization of the NLI to a specific domain. In fact, it merely requires familiarity with the underlying knowledge base as well as with a few basic subcategorization types. Our model is iterative in the sense that the adaption of the NLI is performed in several cycles on the basis of the questions which the NLI failed to answer, thus iteratively increasing the coverage of the system. We provide experimental evidence in form of a user study as well as a case study involving a real-world application corroborating that our model is indeed a feasible way of customizing the interface to a certain domain.

#!This paper deals with a supervised learning method devoted to producing categorization models of text documents. The goal of the method is to use a suitable numerical measurement of example similarity to find centroids describing different categories of examples. The centroids are not abstract or statistical models, but rather consist of bits of examples. The centroid-learning method is based on a Genetic Algorithm for Texts (GAT). The categorization system using this genetic algorithm infers a model by applying the genetic algorithm to each set of preclassified documents belonging to a category. The models thus obtained are the category centroids that are used to predict the category of a test document. The experimental results validate the utility of this approach for classifying incoming documents.

#!In this paper, the authors propose a bridge layer as a framework for the safe and free association of existing content architectures (CA) and payment and rights-management services (CHS: Clearinghouse Services). The unauthorized use of content through the circumvention of payment and rights-management is a serious threat. To eliminate this threat, the CHS must associate with the inherent content protection function provided by the CA closely. However, ad hoc association has problems relating to development and maintenance costs, motivation for association, and security, which become impediments to content distribution. A bridge layer provides a protocol for the association of a CA with the CHS, as well as the security functions called for by association. Because the CA and CHS comply with the bridge layer protocol, association is automatically implemented and the unauthorized use of content through circumvention is prevented. In this paper, the required technical elements of the bridge layer are clarified and an actual system satisfying these requirements is proposed. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!Widespread deployment of sensors in roadways and vehicles is creating new challenges in effectively exploiting the wealth of real-time transportation system data. However, the precision of the real-time data varies depending on the level of data aggregation. For example, minute-by-minute data are more precise than hourly average data. This paper explores the ability to create an accurate estimate of the evolving state of transportation systems using real-time roadway data aggregated at various update intervals. It is found that simulation based on inflow data aggregated over a short time interval is capable of providing a superior representation of the real world over longer aggregate intervals. However, the perceived improvements are minimal under congested conditions and most pronounced under un-congested conditions. In addition, outflow constraints should be considered during congested flow periods, otherwise significant deviation from the real world performance may arise.

#!We consider linear homogeneous differential-algebraic equations A(Dx)' + Bx = 0 and their adjoints -D*(A*x)'+B*x = 0 with well-matched leading coefficients in parallel. Assuming that the equations are tractable with index less than or equal to 2, we give a criterion ensuring the inherent ordinary differential equations of the pair to be adjoint each to other. We describe the basis pairs in the invariant subspaces that yield adjoint pairs of essentially underlying ordinary differential equations. For a class of formally self-adjoint equations, we characterize the boundary conditions that lead to self-adjoint boundary value problems for the essentially underlying Hamiltonian systems.

#!We define "random trip", a generic mobility model for random, independent node motions, which contains as special cases: the random waypoint on convex or nonconvex domains, random walk on torus, billiards, city section, space graph, intercity and other models. We show that, for this model, a necessary and sufficient condition for a time-stationary regime to exist is that the mean trip duration (sampled at trip endpoints) is finite. When this holds, we show that the distribution of node mobility state converges to the time-stationary distribution, starting from the origin of an arbitrary trip. For the special case of random waypoint, we provide for the first time a proof and a sufficient and necessary condition of the existence of a stationary regime, thus closing a long standing issue. We show that random walk on torus and billiards belong to the random trip class of models, and establish that the time-limit distribution of node location for these two models is uniform, for any initial distribution, even in cases where the speed vector does not have circular symmetry. Using Palm calculus, we establish properties of the time-stationary regime, when the condition for its existence holds. We provide an algorithm to sample the simulation state from a time-stationary distribution at time 0 ("perfect simulation"), without computing geometric constants. For random waypoint on the sphere, random walk on torus and billiards, we show that, in the time-stationary regime, the node location is uniform. Our perfect sampling algorithm is implemented to use with ns-2, and is available to download from http://ica1www.epfl.ch/RandomTrip.

#!Images obtained with catadioptric sensors contain significant deformations which prevent the direct use of classical image treatments. Thus, Markov random fields (MRF) whose usefulness is now obvious for projective image processing, cannot be used directly on catadioptric images because of the inadequacy of the neighborhood. In this paper, we propose to define a new neighborhood for MRF by using the equivalence theorem developed for central catadioptric sensors. We show the importance of this adaptation for segmentation, image restoration and motion detection.

#!The Future Combat Systems (FCS) program is developing the FCS System of Systems Simulation Environment (FSE) to provide the "real world wraparound" to the FCS System of Systems Simulation Framework (S2F). A primary component of the FCS is the Communication Effects Server (CES) whose objective is to develop a flexible, scalable, and high-performance, packet-level, discrete-event simulator that will accurately portray the behavior of the FCS communications architecture to eventually support the live, constructive, and virtual simulations envisaged in the FSE. In particular, the CES is required to compute, in real-time, accurate end-end latency for every communication message sent over a wireless network in a FSE experiment.This paper provides an overview of the CES that has been developed using the QualNet network simulator. It presents results on the performance of the CES for the simulation of large on-the-move communication networks in real-time.

#*Using anecdotal information to model the availability of an existing dynamometer system

#index4162
#!Low-volume, custom-built or specialty equipment, by nature, has little statistically significant data to predict system availability over the equipment life. Their unique constructions are often costly to purchase and install, and are equally costly to maintain. This paper presents a practical method to estimate the availability of custom-built equipment, using a custom 4wd NVH dynamometer system as an example. The proposed method models the availability of an existing custom-built system using anecdotal component information based on interviews with field service personnel. The interview data is used to create estimated probability density functions for the major components of the system. Component probability density functions are assembled into a system model based on a derived system reliability function. This technique provides a low-cost, quick, model of system availability over time which can be used to assess the risk and cost effectiveness of system maintenance strategies.

All the maximal cliques generated are output in a tree-like form. Subsequently, we prove that its worst-case time complexity is O(3n/3) for an n-vertex graph. This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments.

#!This paper proposes a novel method for breast cancer diagnosis using the feature generated by genetic programming (GP). We developed a new feature extraction measure (modified Fisher linear discriminant analysis (MFLDA)) to overcome the limitation of Fisher criterion. GP as an evolutionary mechanism provides a training structure to generate features. A modified Fisher criterion is developed to help GP optimize features that allow pattern vectors belonging to different categories to distribute compactly and disjoint regions. First, the MFLDA is experimentally compared with some classical feature extraction methods (principal component analysis, Fisher linear discriminant analysis, alternative Fisher linear discriminant analysis). Second, the feature generated by GP based on the modified Fisher criterion is compared with the features generated by GP using Fisher criterion and an alternative Fisher criterion in terms of the classification performance. The classification is carried out by a simple classifier (minimum distance classifier). Finally, the same feature generated by GP is compared with a original feature set as the inputs to multi-layer perceptrons and support vector machine. Results demonstrate the capability of this method to transform information from high-dimensional feature space into one-dimensional space and automatically discover the relationship among data, to improve classification accuracy.

#!In the past twenty years, there were only a few constructions for Boolean functions with nonlinearity exceeding the quadratic bound 2n-1 - 2(n-1)/2 when n is odd (we shall call them Boolean functions with very high nonlinearity). The first basic construction was by Patterson and Wiedemann in 1983, which produced unbalanced function with very high nonlinearity. But for cryptographic applications, we need balanced Boolean functions. Therefore in 1993, Seberry, Zhang and Zheng proposed a secondary construction for balanced functions with very high nonlinearity by taking the direct sum of a modified bent function with the Patterson-Wiedemann function. Later in 2000, Sarkar and Maitra constructed such functions by taking the direct sum of a bent function with a modified Patterson-Wiedemann function. In this paper, we propose a new secondary construction for balanced Boolean functions with very high nonlinearity by recursively composing balanced functions with very high nonlinearity with quadratic functions. This is the first construction for balanced function with very high nonlinearity not based on the direct sum approach. Our construction also have other desirable properties like high algebraic degree and large linear span.

Do you use Adobe InDesign CS2 and have a strong working knowledge of JavaScript? Then you're in luck. Since Adobe Creative Suite 2 was created with built-in support for scripting, virtually every repetitive or time-consuming task that creative professionals have to do in InDesign can be streamlined or automated with the help of a script. This book describes how to use JavaScript to manipulate and extend Adobe InDesign within Adobe Creative Suite 2, and provides reference information for the JavaScript objects, properties, and functions defined by Adobe's applications, as well as the various utilities and tools that are part of ExtendScript, Adobe 's own implementation of JavaScript. This scripting reference provides the information you need to create custom scripts for InDesign, whether you're looking to automate your company's page layout process, convert large batches of InDesign files to XML, need an easy way to run a find-and-replace sequence within a large document, or want to create a script that instantly adds pre-built design elements to your InDesign page layouts. These are just a few of the ways that scripting can save you from hours of time-consuming tasks.ï¾ The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright © 2010 ACM, Inc.

#!Research in proteomics has created two significant needs: the need for an accurate public database of empirically derived mass spectrum information and the need for managing the I/O and organization of mass spectrometry data in the form of files and structures. Lack of an empirically derived database limits the ability of proteomic researchers to identify and study proteins. Managing the I/O and organization of mass spectrometry data is often time-consuming due to the many fields that need to be set and retrieved. As a result, incompatibilities and inefficiencies are created by each programmer handling this in his or her own way. Until recently, storage space and computing power has been the limiting factor in developing tools to handle the vast amount of mass spectrometry information. Now the resources are available to store, organize, and analyze mass spectrometry information.The Illinois Bio-Grid Mass Spectrometry Database is a database of empirically derived tandem mass spectra of peptides created to provide researchers with an organized and searchable database of curated spectrum information to allow more accurate protein identification. The Mass Spectrometry I/O Project creates a framework that handles mass spectrometry data I/O and data organization, allowing researchers to concentrate on data analysis rather than I/O. In addition, the Mass Spectrometry I/O Project leverages several cross-platform and portability-enhancing technologies, allowing it to be utilized on a variety of hardware and operating systems.

#!Feature selection is used for finding a feature subset that has the most discriminative information from the original feature set. In practice, since we do not know the classifier to be used after feature selection, it is desirable to find a feature subset that is universally effective for any classifier. Such a trial is called classifier-independent feature selection. In this study, we propose a novel classifier-independent feature selection method on the basis of the estimation of Bayes discrimination boundary. The experimental results on 12 real-world datasets showed the fundamental effectiveness of the proposed method.

#!The Simulation-Optimization (SO) problem is a constrained optimization problem where the objective function is observed with error, usually through an oracle such as a simulation. Retrospective Approximation (RA) is a general technique that can be used to solve SO problems. In RA, the solution to the SO problem is approached using solutions to a sequence of approximate problems, each of which is generated using a specified sample size and solved to a specified error tolerance. In this paper, our focus is parameter choice in RA algorithms, where the term parameter is broadly interpreted. Specifically, we present (i) conditions that guarantee convergence of estimated solutions to the true solution; (ii) convergence properties of the sample-size and error-tolerance sequences that ensure that the sequence of estimated solutions converge to the true solution in an optimal fashion; and (iii) a numerical procedure that efficiently solves the generated approximate problems for one-dimensional SO.

#!Due to the static nature of nodes, in mesh networks, a poor choice of paths may remain unchanged for a long time and create hot spots. Hence, it is very important to design path weight functions (also called routing metrics) to facilitate load-balanced routing in mesh networks. Such path weight functions (PWFs) must reflect the shared nature of wireless channels and support easy calculation of loop-free paths. In this abstract, we present our theoretical studies of the requirements on PWFs and design the first PWF, called Metric of Interference and Channel-switching (MIC), that satisfies these requirements. Our simulation results show that MIC's performance is substantially better than existing PWFs. (See our technical report [5] for more details.)

#!ParaEval is an automated evaluation method for comparing reference and peer summaries. It facilitates a tiered-comparison strategy where recall-oriented global optimal and local greedy searches for paraphrase matching are enabled in the top tiers. We utilize a domain-independent paraphrase table extracted from a large bilingual parallel corpus using methods from Machine Translation (MT). We show that the quality of ParaEval's evaluations, measured by correlating with human judgments, closely resembles that of ROUGE's.

#!Most current software systems contain undocumented high-level ideas implemented across multiple files and modules. When developers perform program maintenance tasks, they often waste time and effort locating and understanding these scattered concerns. We have developed a semi-automated concern location and comprehension tool, Find-Concept, designed to reduce the time developers spend on maintenance tasks and to increase their confidence in the results of these tasks. Find-Concept is effective because it searches a unique natural language-based representation of source code, uses novel techniques to expand initial queries into more effective queries, and displays search results in an easy-to-comprehend format. We describe the Find-Concept tool, the underlying program analysis, and an experimental study comparing Find-Concept's search effectiveness with two state-of-the-art lexical and information retrieval-based search tools. Across nine action-oriented concern location tasks derived from open source bug reports, our Eclipse-based tool produced more effective queries more consistently than either competing search tool with similar user effort.

#!EJB 3 in Action tackles EJB 3 and the Java Persistence API head-on, providing practical code samples, real-life scenarios, best practices, design patterns, and performance tuning tips. This book builds on the contributions and strengths of seminal technologies like Spring, Hibernate, and TopLink. EJB 3 is the most important innovation introduced in Java EE 5.0. EJB 3 simplifies enterprise development, abandoning the complex EJB 2.x model in favor of a lightweight POJO framework. The new API represents a fresh perspective on EJB without sacrificing the mission of enabling business application developers to create robust, scalable, standards-based solutions.EJB 3 in Action is a fast-paced tutorial, geared toward helping you learn EJB 3 and the Java Persistence API quickly and easily. For newcomers to EJB, this book provides a solid foundation in EJB. For the developer moving to EJB 3 from EJB 2, this book addresses the changes both in the EJB API and in the way the developer should approach EJB and persistence.

#!Skew estimation and page segmentation are the two closely related processing stages for document image analysis. Skew estimation needs proper page segmentation, especially for document images with multiple skews that are common in scanned images from thick bound publications in 2-up style or postal envelopes with various printed labels. Even if only a single skew is concerned for a document image, the presence of minority regions of different skews or undefined skew such as noise may severely affect the estimation for the dominant skew. Page segmentation, on the other hand, may need to know the exact skew angle of a page in order to work properly. This paper presents a skew estimation method with built-in skew-independent segmentation functionality that is capable of handling document images with multiple regions of different skews. It is based on the convex hulls of the individual components (i.e. the smallest convex polygon that fully contains a component) and that of the component groups (i.e. the smallest convex polygon that fully contain all the components in a group) in a document image. The proposed method first extracts the convex hulls of the components, segments an image into groups of components according to both the spatial distances and size similarities among the convex hulls of the components. This process not only extracts the hints of the alignments of the text groups, but also separate noise or graphical components from that of the textual ones. To verify the proposed algorithms, the full sets of the real and the synthetic samples of the University of Washington English Document Image Database I (UW-I) are used. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with some existing methods are also provided.

However, the technique can be applied to a number of prevalent problems such as (certain) capital budgeting, media selection, plant/warehouse location, seasonal manpower leveling, lockbox, and others. The general model employs zero-one fixed cost (or setup) variables each of which dominates a set of continuous variables. Thus, if a fixed cost variable is at value one, the sum of the dominated set may take on any value up to a stated maximum. On the other hand, if the fixed cost variable is at value zero, all the dominated set is constrained to zero. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!Information systems development uses many different approaches and methodologies, such as soft systems methodology, to assist in the process of development and in the design of more successful information systems. However, many of these methodologies define information systems narrowly and fail to adequately take the larger contextual work environment into account. Activity Theory is a tool, borrowed from the field of psychology and development work research, which facilitates a more holistic view to be adopted by information systems practitioners and developers. In this paper Activity Theory, or more precisely the Activity Analysis and Development (ActAD) model, is used as an analytical tool in the design and development of an information system for an anti-retroviral treatment (ART) clinic in South Africa. The usefulness of applying the ActAD model is shown in this case study which focused on the investigation and observation of the quality of data and its use for decision support in the ART clinic. In addressing the question 'Does Activity Theory assist in highlighting challenges faced by the ART clinic with their current IS and assist in representing what users require from an IS?' we established the usefulness of the ActAD model in four areas. These included the identification of: the need for change; viewing information systems as part of the work activity; recognising the role of different stakeholders, and; the need for on-going support. We conclude that Activity Theory is a useful tool for information systems development and in particular the ActAD model is a tool which enables a more holistic approach to be taken in information systems development.

#!In multiprojector displays which surround users with high-resolution images, a PC-Cluster is often used for realistic and real-time image generation. However, it is quite troublesome to develop applications which support parallel processing on the PC-Cluster. It is also difficult to acquire enough rendering performance because of the limited bandwidth of the PC-Cluster. Therefore, we aim to achieve affordable and accessible software environments for the multiprojector displays. In this paper, we describe a self-distributing software environment for inheriting existent game engines which provide basic functions of realizing virtual environments. This environment achieves minimum data communication based on a master&ndash;slave model. The communication mechanism is automatically applied to target applications by intercepting APIs. Hence, we can directly exploit high capability of the existing game engines on the multiprojector displays. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Numerical results are provided for pricing American-style call and put options written on underlying assets following geometric Brownian motion and Merton jump-diffusion processes. The results from the MRAS algorithm are also compared with the Cross-Entropy (CE) method.

#!Collaborative Filtering systems are essentially social systems which base their recommendation on the judgment of a large number of people. However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation by malicious social elements. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by a malicious user who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, a few malicious user votes and profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system. This can significantly affect the robustness of a system or algorithm, as has been studied in recent work [5, 7]. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of spam profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. In this work, we provide a simple unsupervised algorithm, which exploits statistical properties of effective spam profiles to provide a highly accurate and fast algorithm for detecting spam.

#*Open Source for the Enterprise: Managing Risks Reaping Rewards
#@Dan Woods,Gautam Guliani
#t2005

#index4249
#!Open source software is changing the world of Information Technology. But making it work for your company is far more complicated than simply installing a copy of Linux. If you are serious about using open source to cut costs, accelerate development, and reduce vendor lock-in, you must institutionalize skills and create new ways of working. You must understand how open source is different from commercial software and what responsibilities and risks it brings. Open Source for the Enterprise is a sober guide to putting open source to work in the modern IT department. Open source software is software whose code is freely available to anyone who wants to change and redistribute it. New commercial support services, smaller licensing fees, increased collaboration, and a friendlier platform to sell products and services are just a few of the reasons open source is so attractive to IT departments. Some of the open source projects that are in current, widespread use in businesses large and small include Linux, FreeBSD, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JBOSS, and Perl. These have been used to such great effect by Google, Amazon, Yahoo!, and major commercial and financial firms, that a wave of publicity has resulted in recent years, bordering on hype. Large vendors such as IBM, Novell, and Hewlett Packard have made open source a lynchpin of their offerings. Open source has entered a new area where it is being used as a marketing device, a collaborative software development methodology, and a business model. This book provides something far more valuable than either the cheerleading or the fear-mongering one hears about open source. The authors are Dan Woods, former CTO of TheStreet.com and a consultant and author of several books about IT, and Gautam Guliani, Director of Software Architecture at Kaplan Test Prep & Admissions. Each has used open source software for some 15 years at IT departments large and small. They have collected the wisdom of a host of experts from IT departments, open source communities, and software companies. Open Source for the Enterprise provides a top to bottom view not only of the technology, but of the skills required to manage it and the organizational issues that must be addressed. Here are the sorts of questions answered in the book: Why is there a "productization gap" in most open source projects? How can the maturity of open source be evaluated? How can the ROI of open source be calculated? What skills are needed to use open source? What sorts of open source projects are appropriate for IT departments at the beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert levels? What questions need to be answered by an open source strategy? What policies for governance can be instituted to control the adoption of open source? What new commercial services can help manage the risks of open source? Do differences in open source licenses matter? How will using open source transform an IT department? Praise for Open Source for the Enterprise: "Open Source has become a strategic business issue; decisions on how and where to choose to use Open Source now have a major impact on the overall direction of IT abilities to support the business both with capabilities and by controlling costs. This is a new game and one generally not covered in existing books on Open Source which continue to assume that the readers are 'deep dive' technologists, Open Source for the Enterprise provides everyone from business managers to technologists with the balanced view that has been missing. Well worth the time to read, and also worth encouraging others in your enterprise to read as well." ----Andy Mulholland - Global CTO Capgemini "Open Source for the Enterprise is required reading for anyone working with or looking to adopt open source technologies in a corporate environment. Its practical, no-BS approach will make sure you're armed with the information you need to deploy applications successfully (as well as helping you know when to say "no"). If you're trying to sell open source to management, this book will give you the ammunition you need. If you're a manager trying to drive down cost using open source, this book will tell you what questions to ask your staff. In short, it's a clear, concise explanation of how to successfully leverage open source without making the big mistakes that can get you fired." ----Kevin Bedell - founding editor of LinuxWorld Magazine

#!This paper identifies four security issues (access to Information Systems, secure communication, security management, development of secure Information Systems), and examines the extent to which these security issues have been addressed by existing research efforts. Research contributions in relation to these four security issues are analyzed from three viewpoints: a meta-model for information systems, the research approaches used, and the reference disciplines used. Our survey reveals that most information security research has focused on the technical context, and on issues of access to IS and secure communication. The corresponding security issues have been resolved by using mathematical approaches as a research approach. The reference disciplines most commonly reflected have been mathematics, including philosophical logic. Based on this analysis, we suggest new directions for studying information security from an information systems viewpoint, with respect to research methodology and research questions. Empirical studies in relation to the issues of security management and the development of secure IS, based on suitable reference theories (e.g., psychology, sociology, semiotics, and philosophy), are particularly necessary.

#!Since security is of critical importance for modern storage systems, it is imperative to protect stored data from being tampered with or disclosed. Although an increasing number of secure storage systems have been developed, there is no way to dynamically choose security services to meet disk requests' flexible security requirements. Furthermore, existing security techniques for disk systems are not suitable to guarantee desired response times of disk requests. We remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive strategy (referred to as AWARDS) that can judiciously select the most appropriate security service for each write request, while endeavoring to guarantee the desired response times of all disk requests. To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, we build an analytical model to measure the probability that a disk request is completed before its desired response time. The model also can be used to derive the expected value of disk requests' security levels. Empirical results based on synthetic workloads as well as real I/O-intensive applications show that AWARDS significantly improves overall performance over an existing scheme by up to 358.9&percnt; (with an average of 213.4&percnt;).

#!Reflection on software engineering as a sub-discipline within computer science reveals that it is as much about people and teamwork as it is about technical expertise. It is therefore important that a software engineer is not only competent in software development but also able to work effectively in a team. Based on the scholarly literature we derived a simple model for team composition and used it to guide, without coercion, our students during team formation. This research reports on an investigation into the role of personality diversity within teams of tertiary students taking a course in software engineering. Data collected confirms that both personality diversity in teams as well as competence of teams impacts positively on team performance. In contrast to other studies, our research data does not seek to couple personality with appropriate role allocation in the team; rather, our measurement is in respect of "raw" team diversity alone. In this study the correlation between personality diversity and the success of teams were captured at different stages during the development of a software engineering project tackled by the teams. The same was done with correlation between competence and team success. The personality diversity of the teams showed a strong correlation with team success during the inception phase. This correlation however weakened during the course of the year while the correlation between competence and success started slightly weaker than personality diversity during the inception phase, but grew very strong towards the completion of the team projects.

#!We present a low-power VLSI wake-up detector for a sensor network that uses acoustic signals to localize ground-based vehicles. The detection criterion is the degree of low-frequency periodicity in the acoustic signal, and the periodicity is computed from the &ldquo;bumpiness&rdquo; of the autocorrelation of a one-bit version of the signal. We then describe a CMOS ASIC that implements the periodicity estimation algorithm. The ASIC is fully functional and its core consumes 835 nanowatts. It was integrated into an acoustic enclosure and deployed in field tests with synthesized sounds and ground-based vehicles.

#*Nonuniform sampling for global optimization of kinetic rate constants in biological pathways

#!Global optimization has proven to be a powerful tool for solving parameter estimation problems in biological applications, such as the estimation of kinetic rate constants in pathway models. These optimization algorithms sometimes suffer from slow convergence, stagnation or misconvergence to a non-optimal local minimum. Here we show that a nonuniform sampling method (implemented by running the optimization in a transformed space) can improve convergence and robustness for evolutionary-type algorithms, specifically Differential Evolution and Evolutionary Strategies. Results are shown from two case studies exemplifying the common problems of stagnation and misconvergence.

#!Object tracking has been widely applied to video surveillance, robot localization and human-computer interaction. In this paper, an edge-based tracking algorithm is proposed. We extract the feature points by efficiently utilizing the image edges in the object region. Then the parameter vector of the object's motion model is estimated based on minimizing the sum-of-squared differences between the reference feature points in the reference frame and the observed feature points in the tracking sequence frame. The experiments show that the edge-based tracking algorithm proposed by us can track object efficiently under uniform and varying illumination conditions.

#!Image authentication has come through a history of several years. However, up to the present time, most mainstream image authentication schemes are still unable to detect burst bit errors. Moreover, the capability of recovering tampered pixels in detail (complex) areas has not been very satisfactory either. In this paper, we offer to combine the Hamming code technique, Torus automorphism and bit rotation technique to do tamper proofing. According to our experimental results, our new hybrid method can effectively eliminate burst bit errors, and our recovered pixels in detail areas can actually gain very high clarity. The results show that our scheme is quite a practical method, which is quite able to detect and recover tampered areas.

#!Distributed simulation is attractive for modeling complicated manufacturing systems having many tools and products, such as a semiconductor wafer fabrication line. However, conservative synchronization approaches can introduce excessive overhead in execution, and result in little parallelism, which can eliminate the speedup promised by distributed simulation. Our experiences in building a distributed simulation model for 300mm wafer fab using the High Level Architecture (HLA) shows that using model specific information in a novel adaptation of conservative synchronization can achieve very significant reduction in model execution time. This paper defines the time-chop problem for which this adaptation is effective, and formally develops our optimistic-conservative synchronization scheme.

#!cJ is an extension of Java that allows supertypes, fields, and methods of a class or interface to be provided only under some static subtyping condition. For instance, a cJ generic class, C<P>, may provide a member method m only when the type provided for parameter P is a subtype of a specific type Q.From a practical standpoint, cJ adds to generic Java classes and interfaces the ability to express case-specific code. Unlike conditional compilation techniques (e.g., the C/C++ "#ifdef" construct) cJ is statically type safe and maintains the modular type-checking properties of Java generic classes: a cJ generic class can be checked independently of the code that uses it. Just like regular Java, checking a cJ class implies that all uses are safe, under the contract for type parameters specified in the class's signature.As a specific application, cJ addresses the well-known shortcomings of the Java Collections Framework (JCF). JCF data structures often throw run-time errors when an "optional" method is called upon an object that does not support it. Within the constraints of standard Java, the authors of the JCF had to either sacrifice static type safety or suffer a combinatorial explosion of the number of types involved. cJ avoids both problems, maintaining both static safety and conciseness.

In contrast, Peter-Paul Koch's book uses eight real-world scripts he created for real-world clients in order to earn real-world money. That means the scripts are guaranteed to do something useful (and sellable!) that enhances the usability of the page they're used on.The book's example scripts include one that sorts a data table according to the user's search queries, a form validation script, a script that shows form fields only when the user needs them, a drop-down menu, and a data retrieval script that uses simple Ajax and shows the data in an animation.After an overview of JavaScript's purpose, Peter-Paul provides theoretical chapters on the context (jobs for JavaScript, CSS vs. JavaScript), the browsers (debugging, the arcana of the browser string), and script preparation. Then follow practical chapters on Core, BOM, Events, DOM, CSS Modification, and Data Retrieval, all of which are explained through a combination of theoretical instruction and the taking apart of the relevant sections of the example scripts.

#*Efficient and Tailored Resource Management for the P2P Web Caching
#@Kyungbaek Kim,Daeyeon Park
#t2007
#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index4315
#!While web proxy caching is a widely deployed technique, the performance of a proxy cache is limited by the local storage. Some studies have addressed this limitation by using the residual resources of clients via a p2p method and have achieved a very high hit rate. However, these approaches treat web objects as homogeneous objects and there is no consideration of various web characteristics. Consequently, the byte hit rate of the system is limited, external bandwidth is wasted, and perceived user latency is increased. The present paper suggests an efficient p2p based web caching technique that manages objects with different policies so as to exploit the characteristics of web objects, such as size and temporal locality. Small objects are stored alone whereas large objects are stored by dividing them into numerous small blocks, which are distributed in clients. On a proxy cache, header blocks of large objects take the place of objects themselves and smaller objects are cached. This technique increases the hit rate. Unlike a web cache, which evicts large objects as soon as possible in the case where clients fulfill the role of backup storage, large objects are given higher priority than small objects in the proposed approach. This maximizes the effect of hits for large objects and thereby increases the byte hit rate. Furthermore, we construct simple latency models for various p2p based web caching systems and analyze the effects of the proposed policies on these systems. We then examine the performances of the efficient policies via a trace driven simulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed techniques effectively enhance web cache performance, including hit rate, byte hit rate, and response time.

Chari, Two decompositions in topological combinatorics with applications to matroid complexes, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 349 (1997) 3925-3943]. Nyman and Swartz raised the problem of whether or not the corresponding g-vector is an M-vector [K. Nyman, E. Swartz, Inequalities for h- and flag h-vectors of geometric lattices, Discrete Comput. Geom. 32 (2004) 533-548]. This is proved to be true by showing that the set of pairs (ω, Θ), where Θ is a l.s.o.p. for k[Δ], the face ring of Δ, and ω is a g-element for k[Δ]/Θ, is nonempty whenever the characteristic of k is zero.Finite buildings have a convex ear decomposition. These decompositions point to inequalities on the flag h-vector of such spaces similar in spirit to those examined in [K. Nyman, E. Swartz, Inequalities for h- and flag h-vectors of geometric lattices, Discrete Comput. Geom. 32 (2004) 533-548] for order complexes of geometric lattices. This also leads to connections between higher Cohen-Macaulay connectivity and conditions which insure that h0 < ... < hi for a predetermined i.

#!In this paper, we compare the performances of classifier combination methods (bagging, modified random subspace method, classifier selection, parametric fusion) to logistic regression in consideration of various characteristics of input data. Four factors used to simulate the logistic model are: (a) combination function among input variables, (b) correlation between input variables, (c) variance of observation, and (d) training data set size. In view of typically unknown combination function among input variables, we use a Taguchi design to improve the practicality of our study results by letting it as an uncontrollable factor. Our experimental study results indicate the following: when training set size is large, performances of logistic regression and bagging are not significantly different. However, when training set size is small, the performance of logistic regression is worse than bagging. When training data set size is small and correlation is strong, both modified random subspace method and bagging perform better than the other three methods. When correlation is weak and variance is small, both parametric fusion and classifier selection algorithm appear to be the worst at our disappointment.

We introduce a recursive, linear time and fully implicit method to solve the stiff dynamical problem arising from such a multi-body system. We augment the merits of the proposed scheme by means of analytical constraints and an elaborate collision response model. We finally discuss a versatile simulation system based on the strand primitive for character dynamics and visual effects. We demonstrate dynamics of ears, braid, long/curly hair and foliage.

#!This paper develops a new methodology for pattern classification by concurrently determined k piecewise linear and convex discriminant functions. Toward the end, we design a new l1-norm distance metric for measuring misclassification errors and use it to develop a mixed 0-1 integer and linear program (MILP) for the k piecewise linear and convex separation of data. The proposed model is meritorious in that it considers the synergy as well as the individual role of the k hyperplanes in constructing a decision surface and exploits the advances in theory and algorithms and the advent of powerful softwares for MILP for its solution. With artificially created data, we illustrate pros and cons of pattern classification by the proposed methodology. With six benchmark classification datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and competitive with well-established learning methods. In summary, the classifiers constructed by the proposed approach obtain the best prediction rates on three of the six datasets and the second best records for two of the remaining three datasets.

#!A polynomial method is described for computing the shortest circuit with a prescribed homotopy on a surface. The surface is not described by a mesh but by a constellation: a set of sampling points. Points close enough (their distance is less than a prescribed threshold) are linked with an edge: the induced graph is not a triangulation but still permits to compute homologic and homotopic properties. Advantages of constellations over meshes are their simplicity and robustness.

#!A recognition system for handwritten Bangla numerals and its application to automatic letter sorting machine for Bangladesh Post is presented. The system consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, recognition and integration. Based on the theories of principal component analysis (PCA), two novel approaches are proposed for recognizing handwritten Bangla numerals. One is the image reconstruction recognition approach, and the other is the direction feature extraction approach combined with PCA and SVM. By examining the handwritten Bangla numeral data captured from real Bangladesh letters, the experimental results show that our proposed approaches are effective. To meet performance requirements of automatic letter sorting machine, we integrate the results of the two proposed approaches with one conventional PCA approach. It has been found that the recognition result achieved by the integrated system is more reliable than that by one method alone. The average recognition rate, error rate and reliability achieved by the integrated system are 95.05%, 0.93% and 99.03%, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that the integrated system also meets speed requirement.

#!PowerPoint is the world's most widely used presentation program, a favorite of educators, trainers, and, of course, those in business everywhere. Yet, every time Microsoft releases a new version of the program, they introduce another set of features---most of which you'll never understand or use. Even if you have experience with PowerPoint, you'll struggle to keep up with the improvements. If you're a beginner, you probably don't know where to start. Now, with PowerPoint 2003 Personal Trainer, beginners and experts alike can become black belts with this presentation program, quickly and easily. This fully illustrated book takes a modular approach to learning, allowing you to start with the fundamentals and work your way to advance topics through dozens of task-oriented lessons--at your own pace. The companion CD tutorial guides you through each lesson interactively. PowerPoint 2003 Personal Trainer includes sections on editing, formatting, drawing, working with word art, tables, organization charts, multimedia, other programs, the Internet, and how to optimize presentation delivery. Every chapter includes detailed diagrams and a review at the end to help you absorb and retain all you have learned. If you already use PowerPoint, you can dive right into those topics (and only those topics) that you need or want to learn. Unlike many consumer software tutorials that dumb down the material or present it in a confusing fashion, PowerPoint 2003 Personal Trainer is written in a non-technical and engaging style that you will find fun, easy, and most of all, clear and informative. You don't have to wade through tons of jargon and technical information to become proficient. Part of our new Personal Trainer Series, this book is based on content from CustomGuide (http://www.customguide.com), a leading provider of computer training materials.

#!We introduce Probabilistic Resilient Multicast (PRM): a multicast data recovery scheme that improves data delivery ratios while maintaining low end-to-end latencies. PRM has both a proactive and a reactive components; in this paper we describe how PRM can be used to improve the performance of application-layer multicast protocols especially when there are high packet losses and host failures. Through detailed analysis in this paper, we show that this loss recovery technique has efficient scaling properties-the overheads at each overlay node asymptotically decrease to zero with increasing group sizes.As a detailed case study, we show how PRM can be applied to the NICE application-layer multicast protocol. We present detailed simulations of the PRM-enhanced NICE protocol for 10000 node Internet-like topologies. Simulations show that PRM achieves a high delivery ratio (>97%) with a low latency bound (600 ms) for environments with high end-to-end network losses (1%-5%) and high topology change rates (5 changes per second) while incurring very low overheads (<5%).

#cBioinformatics
#index4400
#!Motivation: With the rapid increase in the availability of biological graph datasets, there is a growing need for effective and efficient graph querying methods. Due to the noisy and incomplete characteristics of these datasets, exact graph matching methods have limited use and approximate graph matching methods are required. Unfortunately, existing graph matching methods are too restrictive as they only allow exact or near exact graph matching. This paper presents a novel approximate graph matching technique called SAGA. This technique employs a flexible model for computing graph similarity, which allows for node gaps, node mismatches and graph structural differences. SAGA employs an indexing technique that allows it to efficiently evaluate queries even against large graph datasets. Results: SAGA has been used to query biological pathways and literature datasets, which has revealed interesting similarities between distinct pathways that cannot be found by existing methods. These matches associate seemingly unrelated biological processes, connect studies in different sub-areas of biomedical research and thus pose hypotheses for new discoveries. SAGA is also orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. Availability: SAGA can be accessed freely via the web at http://www.eecs.umich.edu/saga. Binaries are also freely available at this website.

The master was treated by C4F8 plasma to form a conformal anti-adhesion layer. Lens arrays were replicated on polymer substrates by hot embossing. Microlenses with a large numerical aperture could be fabricated with this method. This work facilitates and simplifies fabrication steps for microlenses.

In this paper, we present and discuss the formal descriptions, the relationship among real microoperations as well as the factors by which the concurrency of microoperations can be identified; we also show the vitality of these three kinds of description mentioned above in allowing the high level microprogramming language being machine-independent, and the generality of microcode compaction algorithm.

#!Motivation: Genome maps are fundamental to the study of an organism and essential in the process of genome sequencing which in turn provides the ultimate map of the genome. The increased number of genomes being sequenced offers new opportunities for the mapping of closely related organisms. We propose here an algorithmic formalization of a genome comparison approach to marker ordering. Results: In order to integrate a comparative mapping approach in the algorithmic process of map construction and selection, we propose to extend the usual statistical model describing the experimental data, here radiation hybrids (RH) data, in a statistical framework that models additionally the evolutionary relationships between a proposed map and a reference map: an existing map of the corresponding orthologous genes or markers in a closely related organism. This has concretely the effect of exploiting, in the process of map selection, the information of marker adjacencies in the related genome when the information provided by the experimental data is not conclusive for the purpose of ordering. In order to compute efficiently the map, we proceed to a reduction of the maximum likelihood estimation to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Experiments on simulated RH datasets as well as on a real RH dataset from the canine RH project show that maps produced using the likelihood defined by the new model are significantly better than maps built using the traditional RH model. Availability: The comparative mapping approach is available in the last version of de Givry,S. et al.

#!This paper describes and evaluates Fireflies, a scalable protocol for supporting intrusion-tolerant network overlays. While such a protocol cannot distinguish Byzantine nodes from correct nodes in general, Fireflies provides correct nodes with a reasonably current view of which nodes are live, as well as a pseudo-random mesh for communication. The amount of data sent by correct nodes grows linearly with the aggregate rate of failures and recoveries, even if provoked by Byzantine nodes. The set of correct nodes form a connected submesh; correct nodes cannot be eclipsed by Byzantine nodes. Fireflies is deployed and evaluated on PlanetLab.

#!Recent growth of the geospatial information on the web has made it possible to easily access a wide variety of spatial data. The ability to combine various sets of geospatial data into a single composite dataset has been one of central issues of modern geographic information processing. By conflating diverse spatial datasets, one can support a rich set of queries that could have not been answered given any of these sets in isolation. However, automatically conflating geospatial data from different data sources remains a challenging task. This is because geospatial data obtained from various data sources may have different projections, different accuracy levels and different formats (e.g., raster or vector format), thus resulting in various positional inconsistencies. Most of the existing algorithms only deal with vector to vector data conflation or require human intervention to accomplish vector data to imagery conflation. In this paper, we describe a novel geospatial data fusion approach, named AMS-Conflation, which achieves automatic vector to imagery conflation. We describe an efficient technique to automatically generate control point pairs from the orthoimagery and vector data by exploiting the information from the vector data to perform localized image processing on the orthoimagery. We also evaluate a filtering technique to automatically eliminate inaccurate pairs from the generated control points. We show that these conflation techniques can automatically align the roads in orthoimagery, such that 75% of the conflated roads are within 3.6 meters from the real road axes compared to 35% for the original vector data for partial areas of the county of St. Louis, MO.

#!Stochastic optimization problems attempt to model uncertainty in the data by assuming that the input is specified by a probability distribution. We consider the well-studied paradigm of 2-stage models with recourse: first, given only distributional information about (some of) the data one commits on initial actions, and then once the actual data is realized (according to the distribution), further (recourse) actions can be taken. We show that for a broad class of 2-stage linear models with recourse, one can, for any &epsi; > 0, in time polynomial in 1/&epsi; and the size of the input, compute a solution of value within a factor (1&plus;&epsi;) of the optimum, in spite of the fact that exponentially many second-stage scenarios may occur. In conjunction with a suitable rounding scheme, this yields the first approximation algorithms for 2-stage stochastic integer optimization problems where the underlying random data is given by a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; and no restrictions are placed on the costs in the two stages. Our rounding approach for stochastic integer programs shows that an approximation algorithm for a deterministic analogue yields, with a small constant-factor loss, provably near-optimal solutions for the stochastic generalization. Among the range of applications, we consider are stochastic versions of the multicommodity flow, set cover, vertex cover, and facility location problems.

#!In a network of bufferless packet multiplexers, the user-perceived capacity of an ingress-egress tunnel (connection) may degrade quickly with increasing path length. This is due to the compounding of transmission blocking probabilities along the path of the connection, even when the links are not overloaded. In such an environment, providing users (e.g., client ISPs) with tunnels of statistically guaranteed bandwidth may limit the network's connection-carrying capacity.In this paper, we introduce and analyze a transmission-scheduling algorithm that employs randomization and traffic regulation at the ingress, and batch scheduling at the links. The algorithm ensures that a fraction of transmissions from each connection is consistently subject to small blocking probability at every link, so that these transmissions are likely to survive long paths. For this algorithm, we obtain tight bounds on the expectation and tail probability of the blocking rate of any ingress-egress connection. We compare the bounds to those obtained using the FCFS link-scheduling rule. We find that the proposed scheduling algorithm significantly improves the network's connection-carrying capacity.In deriving the desired bounds, we develop an analytic framework for stochastically comparing network-wide routing and bandwidth allocation scenarios with respect to blocking in a packet multiplexer. The framework enables us to formally characterize the routing and bandwidth allocation scenarios that maximize the expected blocking rate along the path of a tagged connection.

#%214244

#!In this paper, we explore the use of wavelet based denoising techniques to improve the Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation performance of array processors at low SNR. Traditional single sensor wavelet denoising techniques are not suitable for this application since they fail to preserve the intersensor signal correlation. We propose two correlation preserving techniques for denoising multi-sensor signals: (1) the Temporal Wavelet Array Denoising (TWAD) technique developed by Rao and Jones [IEEE Trans. Signal Processing, vol. 48, pp. 1225---1234, 2000], and (2) a new Spatial Wavelet Array Denoising (SWAD) technique. It is shown that SWAD offers the advantage of a significant reduction in computational complexity at the cost of a slight reduction in SNR gain. The denoised array data is used for DOA estimation by the MUSIC algorithm. Simulation results are presented for MUSIC (without denoising), TWAD-MUSIC, and SWAD-MUSIC, to illustrate the improvement in DOA estimation performance brought about by denoising.

#!Emerging technologies have attracted a substantial interest in overcoming the physical limitations of CMOS as projected at the end of the Technology Roadmap; among these technologies, quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) relies on different and novel paradigms to implement dense, low power circuits and systems for high-performance computing. As applicable to existing technologies, a hierarchical process can be utilized to facilitate the design of QCA circuits. Tools and methodologies both at system and physical levels are required to support all design phases. This article presents an HDL model to describe QCA &ldquo;devices&rdquo; (also referred elsewhere in the technical literature as building blocks, i.e., majority voter, inverter, wire, crossover) and facilitate the evaluation of their design. This tool, referred to as HDLQ, allows a designer to verify the logic characteristics of a QCA system, while supporting within a design environment different operational mechanisms (such as fault injection) and the unique features of QCA (such as bidirectionality and timing/clocking partitioning). The applicability of this design environment to various memory circuits for logic and timing verification is presented in detail. Various defective conditions for kinks due to thermodynamic effects and permanent faults due to manufacturing defects are considered for injection.

#!We consider the problem of monitoring variability of autocorrelated processes. This paper combines variance estimation techniques from the simulation literature with a statistical process control chart from statistical process control (SPC) literature. The proposed SPC method does not require any assumptions on the distribution of the underlying process and uses a variance estimate from each batch as a basic observation. The control limits of the chart are determined analytically. The proposed chart is tested using stationary processes with both normal and non-normal marginals.

Or maybe you're a professional who's been using another program but is now switching to Macromedia's leading web design tool. Learning Dreamweaver 8 gets you up to speed, quickly and efficiently. Straightforwardly practical, with speed as the by-word, this hands-on guide focuses on the best practices for constructing both interactive and static web sites. While explaining core concepts clearly and thoroughly, so that beginners have a solid conceptural and technical foundation, it cuts through the clutter that might slow down a beginner tackling a subject as vast as web design and a tool as robust as Dreamweaver. Dreamweaver 8 Design and Construction emphasizes learning by doing, with short, task-oriented chapters that demonstrate theory by presenting design solutions and explaining the principles that make them work. Plenty of screen shots, illustrations, and sample layouts accompany rapid prototyping techniques for site production. Marc Campbell has been building web sites since 1997-for everything from comic book fan communities to state government portals and e-commerce applications. A Macromedia Certified Dreamweaver Developer and beta tester, he has taught web design to students at all levels and has written eight books on the subject. Sidebars in Dreamweaver 8 Design and Construction allow readers to decide how deeply they want to delve into the subject. "Best Bets" offer bottom-line recommendations for those who want to skip the general discussion, while "Behind the Scenes" sidebars provide more in-depth looks at particular topics for those who want more detail. Absolute beginner or faux debutante, you'll learn proven procedures for quickly building Dreamweaver sites. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!This work presents numerical assessments of possible routing paths for the reported late Pleistocene Missoula floods, which involved Earth's largest known peak discharges of freshwater. For our numerical model, we adopt the diffusion wave approximation of the shallow-water equation with the empirical Manning coefficient. This simplification is required because (1) most previous studies are one-dimensional or analytical studies based on simple equations, so that our two-dimensional expansion is a natural step towards more sophisticated models; (2) a simple model can easily incorporate the effect of complicated topography; and (3) lower computational costs permit a broader exploration of parameters. Important and new insights obtained from this work include: (1) numerically, we confirm the presence of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet at the time of the Missoula floods; (2) floods with relatively small peak discharges cannot inundate some major reaches, including the Cheney Palouse Scabland Tract; (3) deposits indicative of multiple floods are mostly confined in the locations that can be inundated by relatively lower peak flood discharges; and (4) although Lake Missoula glacial lake failure scenario can reasonably reproduce extensive water coverage, the best fit result to the geological evidence of flooding is obtained when the total water volume is three times larger than that estimated for Glacial Lake Missoula. The above results do not negate previous works, but indicate the need for further detailed field investigation and more sophisticated modeling in order to pursue further understanding of the complex behavior of megaflooding in the Channeled Scabland.

#!Performance evaluation of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems is an important but still unsolved problem. The reason for its importance is that only performance evaluation allows for comparison and integration of different CBIR systems. We propose an image retrieval system that splits the retrieval process into two stages. Users are querying the system through image description using a set of local semantic concepts and the size of the image area to be covered by the particular concept. In Stage I of the system, only small patches of the image are analyzed whereas in the second stage the patch information is processed and the relevant images are retrieved. In this two-stage retrieval system, the retrieval performance, that is precision and recall, can be modeled statistically. Based on the model, we develop closed-form expressions that allow for the prediction as well as the optimization of the retrieval performance. As shown through experiments, the retrieval precision can be increased by up to 55% and the retrieval recall by up to 25% depending on the user query.

#!Implicit surfaces are given as the zero set of a function F:&#x211d;3&#x2192;&#x211d;. Although several algorithms exist for generating piecewise linear approximations, most of these are based on a user-defined stepsize or bounds to indicate the precision, and therefore cannot guarantee topological correctness. Interval arithmetic provides a mechanism to determine global properties of the implicit function. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses these properties to generate a piecewise linear approximation of implicit curves and surfaces, that is isotopic to the curve or surface itself. The algorithm is simple and fast, and is among the first to guarantee isotopy for implicit surface meshing.

#!We consider two systems: M/G/1 with a finite workload capacity and an infinite dam model under PMλ policy. It is necessary to analyze the workload processes for these systems, which is mostly difficult and complex. An efficient and easy approximation procedure for these systems is provided. Our method is based on the idea that the service time of a customer can be approximated as the sum of small deterministic service times of a batch of customers. This enables us to work with system size processes instead of workload processes. The proposed method turns out to be in excellent agreement with simulation results and exact solution.

#!The goal of this paper is to model and detect composition conflicts related to introductions. Within this context, we identify several categories of composition conflicts. To analyze the causes of these conflicts precisely, we first model the structure of programs as graphs. Next, we model introductions as graph transformation rules. We define explicit rules to describe when composition conflicts related to introductions occur. We built a prototype tool that detects and visualizes the occurrence of such conflicts in AspectJ programs, making use of an existing graph analysis and rewriting tool. The graph-based models are generated automatically from the source code of Java programs and AspectJ introductions. However, our approach does not make strong assumptions about either the aspect or base language; it has been designed to be applicable to other AOP languages.

#!The paper focuses on the assignment of a common bandwidth resource to TCP connections over a satellite channel. The connections are grouped according to their source-destination pairs, which correspond to the up- and down-link channels traversed, and each group may experience different fading conditions. By exploiting the tradeoff between bandwidth and channel redundancy (as determined by bit and coding rates) in the maximization of TCP goodput, an overall optimization problem is constructed, which can be solved by numerical techniques. Different relations between goodput maximization and fairness of the allocations are investigated, and a possible pricing scheme is proposed. The allocation strategies are tested and compared in a fading environment, first under static conditions, and then in a real dynamic scenario. The goodput-fairness optimization allows significant gains over bandwidth allocations only aimed at keeping the channel bit error rate below a given threshold in all fading conditions.

#!Fingerprint matching is still a challenging problem for reliable person authentication because of the complex distortions involved in two impressions of the same finger. In this paper, we propose a fingerprint-matching approach based on genetic algorithms (GA), which tries to find the optimal transformation between two different fingerprints. In order to deal with low-quality fingerprint images, which introduce significant occlusion and clutter of minutiae features, we design a fitness function based on the local properties of each triplet of minutiae. The experimental results on National Institute of Standards and Technology fingerprint database, NIST-4, not only show that the proposed approach can achieve good performance even when a large portion of fingerprints in the database are of poor quality, but also show that the proposed approach is better than another approach, which is based on mean-squared error estimation.

#!A model for segmentation of an object space by an array of binary, radiation-field sensors and geometric reference structures is described. Given a family of binary, radiation-field sensors and a geometric reference structure, we refer to the set of sensor states induced by a source at point p as the signature of p. We study the segmentation of an object space into signature cells and prove near optimal bounds on the number of distinct signatures induced by a point source, as a function of sensor and reference structure complexity. We also show that almost any family of signatures can be implemented under this model.

#!Supply chain network (SCN) design is to provide an optimal platform for efficient and effective supply chain management. It is an important and strategic operations management problem in supply chain management, and usually involves multiple and conflicting objectives such as cost, service level, resource utilization, etc. This paper proposes a new solution procedure based on genetic algorithms to find the set of Pareto-optimal solutions for multi-objective SCN design problem. To deal with multi-objective and enable the decision maker for evaluating a greater number of alternative solutions, two different weight approaches are implemented in the proposed solution procedure. An experimental study using actual data from a company, which is a producer of plastic products in Turkey, is carried out into two stages. While the effects of weight approaches on the performance of proposed solution procedure are investigated in the first stage, the proposed solution procedure and simulated annealing are compared according to quality of Pareto-optimal solutions in the second stage.

#!We describe our work on qualitative physics for modelling movable objects in Twilight City, a virtual environment for Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT). Movable objects such as chairs, boxes, bottles, etc. are quite common in real life. However, the computational cost will be high if the exact physics laws are used to model the behaviour of these objects. To reduce the computational cost of simulating moveable objects in Twilight City, a framework for qualitative behaviour simulation has been proposed and integrated into our simulation engine. Example results show that the proposed framework is successful in modelling the dynamic behaviour of various movable objects in Twilight City in terms of human players' perceptions and responsiveness of the system.

The procedure computes sample densities at certain points and uses Lagrange interpolation to estimate the density f (x). Even though the proposed sequential procedure is a heuristic, it does have strong basis. Our empirical results show that the procedure gives density estimates that satisfy a pre-specified precision requirement. An experimental performance evaluation demonstrates the validity of using the procedure to estimate densities.

#!The studying and teaching of the analysis of algorithmic concepts can prove to be complex for both students and educators in algorithm courses. Traditional instructional aids such as textbook illustrations and other visual aids are attempts to address this challenge. A number of algorithm animation systems have emerged to address the limitation inherent in these static visual aids. One limitation of current algorithm animation systems is their restricted flexibility in terms of the simple addition of non-resident functionality, especially algorithms. This paper presents the design of an extensible framework for algorithm animation systems. A brief discussion on the development of a prototype using sorting algorithms based on the framework demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed design.

The papers all focus on tools and techniques for cost-effective application of formal methods on the industrial scale. The papers discuss a range of approaches, including the development of domain-specific and general-purpose techniques, and the construction of suites of cooperating but specialised tools. In spite of the diversity of approach, the papers share some themes, notably the levels of automation that are possible at appropriate levels of abstraction, and the incorporation of formal techniques within existing development paradigms. Although three papers cannot provide a comprehensive view, they do provide a useful &#x201c;snapshot&#x201d; of dominant concerns in industrial-strength formal methods today.

#!While many developments have taken place around supporting the model coding task of simulation, there are few tools available to assist in the conceptual modelling phase. Several authors have reported the advantages of using process modelling tools in the early phases of a simulation project. This paper provides an overview of process modelling tools in relation to their support for simulation, categorizing the tools into formal method and descriptive methods. A conclusion from this review is that none of the tools available adequately support the requirements gathering phase of simulation. This is not surprising as none of the process modelling tools were developed for explicit support of simulation. The paper then presents results of research into developing a new process modelling method for simulation.

#*A comparison of transportation network resilience under simulated system optimum and user equilibrium conditions
#@Pamela M. Murray-Tuite
#t2006
#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index4588
#!Resilience is a characteristic that indicates system performance under unusual conditions, recovery speed, and the amount of outside assistance required for restoration to its original functional state. Resilience is important for daily events, such as vehicle crashes, and more extreme events, such as hurricanes and terrorist attacks. Transportation resilience has ten dimensions: redundancy, diversity, efficiency, autonomous components, strength, collaboration, adaptability, mobility, safety, and the ability to recover quickly. This paper examines the influence of the system optimal and user equilibrium traffic assignments on the last four dimensions. No widely accepted measurement of resilience is available for transportation systems; this paper presents multiple metrics for the four examined contributing components that will aid future development of a single measure of resilience. An application of these measures to a test network found that user equilibrium results in better adaptability and safety while system optimum yields better mobility and faster recovery.

If you're a database administrator or programmer you probably love the myriad of things MySQL can do, but sometimes wish there wasn't such a myriad of things to remember. With MySQL in a Nutshell by your keyboard, you can drill down into the full depth of MySQL's capabilities quickly and easily. MySQL in a Nutshell is the indispensable desktop reference to all MySQL functions. Programming language APIs for PHP, Perl, and C are covered, as well as all the popular MySQL utilities. This invaluable resource clearly documents the details that experienced users need to take full advantage of this powerful database management system. Better yet, this wealth of information is packed into the concise, comprehensive, and extraordinarily easy-to-use format for which the in a Nutshell guides are renowned. In addition to providing a thorough reference to MySQL statements and functions, the administrative utilities, and the most popular APIs, MySQL in a Nutshell includes several tutorial chapters to help newcomers get started. Moreover, each chapter covering an API begins with a brief tutorial so that, regardless of your level of experience in any given area, you will be able to understand and master unfamiliar territory. MySQL in a Nutshell distills all the vital MySQL details you need on a daily basis into one convenient, well-organized book.

#!Clustered Objects (COs) [1] have been proven to be an effective abstraction for improving scalability of systems software [2, 3]. But can we devise a programming model that would allow COs to live outside the specialized environments of these operating systems and still provide benefit? This paper presents an overview of SCOPE (Scalable COs with Portability Events), a prototype user-level library derived from the original implementation of COs in the K42 OS. Our initial results indicate that not only do the benefits of COs hold, but that the notion of a "portability event", responsible for maintaining the runtime environment of COs, provides a powerful programming model that will enable COs to be seamlessly transplanted into systems beyond K42. This paper overviews this programming model, provides details and preliminary results from its prototype implementation in SCOPE, and provides motivation to consider simple language mechanisms to further support portability events and this programming model in general.

#!SIMUL8-PLANNER is a simulation-based planning and scheduling tool that intelligently sequences product flow across the plant. Combining order planning with production modeling, SIMUL8-PLANNER can generate production schedules that satisfy delivery objectives and capacity limits. This paper examines a case study where the SIMUL8-PLANNER tool was used to answer the complex scheduling problem of sequencing part requirements through a Composites Manufacturing Center. First a production model was used to capture the current workings of plant processes and product flow. Next, a sequencing system was added to the production model in order to provide a powerful, flexible, and adaptive scheduling system for all of the work cells and machines within the facility, complete with links to the company's ERP / shop-floor data systems. SIMUL8-Planner provides a practical approach and powerful platform for developing, testing, and refining production schedules before they are released to the shop-floor in a virtual and risk-free setting. It offers a flexible and open scheduling system that can be used for a wide range of production scheduling applications.

The generic nature of the channel model allows the user to introduce functions describing the propagation characteristics of the actual wireless medium, e.g., the impact of distance on signal level and interference, as well as the relationship between the signal-to-interference ratio and the probability of a successful packet reception. To illustrate the capabilities of the supported extensions, we review an example of a shadowing channel model.

#!Various monitoring and performance evaluation tools generate considerable amount of low priority traffic. This information is not always needed in real time and often can be delayed by the network without hurting functionality. This paper proposes a new framework to handle this low priority, but resource consuming traffic in such a way that it incurs a minimal interference with the higher priority traffic. Consequently, this improves the network goodput. The key idea is allowing the network nodes to delay data by locally storing it. This can be done, for example, in the Active Network paradigm.In this paper we show that such a model can improve the network's goodput dramatically even if a very simple scheduling algorithm for intermediate parking is used. The parking imposes additional load on the intermediate nodes. To obtain minimal cost schedules we define an optimization problem called the traveling miser problem.We concentrate on the on-line version of the problem for a predefined route, and develop a number of enhanced scheduling strategies. We study their characteristics under different assumptions on the environment through a rigorous simulation study.We prove that if only one link can be congested, then our scheduling algorithm is O(log2 B) competitive, where B is congestion time, and is 3-competitive, if additional signaling is allowed.

#!We explore M/G/&infin; systems 'fed' by Poissonian inflows with infinite arrival rates. Three processes --- corresponding to the system's state, workload, and queue-size --- are studied and analyzed. Closed form formulae characterizing the system's stationary structure and correlation structure are derived. And, the issues of queue finiteness, workload summability, and Long Range Dependence are investigated. We then turn to devise a 'reverse engineering' scheme for the design of the system's correlation structure. Namely: how to construct an M/G/&infin; system with a pre-desired 'target' workload/queue auto-covariance function. The 'reverse engineering' scheme is applied to various examples, including ones with infinite queues and non-summable workloads.

Nowhere is that magic more apparent than in its LAB color processing capabilities, which can make even the subtle canyon colors of rock, sand, and dirt come to vivid life. However, you may be wary of taming the complex beast. Here's your guide! In these pages, Dan shows that you can derive enormous benefits from just a few simple tools and techniques. He also demonstrates that you can take these techniques as far as you wish, employing the power-user features he describes in later chapters. Starting with canyons and progressing to faces, you will see just how quickly you can begin improving your images by following the “recipes” included here. Each chapter includes a sidebar with review questions and exercises as well as a “Closer Look” section that examines some of the principles behind the techniques. A CD includes exercise files.

#!A new knowledge representation language, called QDLP, which extends DLP to deal with uncertain values is introduced. Each (quantitative) rule is assigned a certainty degree interval (a subinterval of [0,1]). The propagation of uncertainty information from the premises to the conclusion of a quantitative rule is achieved by means of triangular norms (T&dash;norms). Different T&dash;norms induce different semantics for one given quantitative program. In this sense, QDLP is parameterized and each choice of a T&dash;norm induces a different QDLP language. Each T&dash;norm is eligible for events with determinate relationships (e.g., independence, exclusiveness) between them. Since there are infinitely many T&dash;norms, it turns out that there is a family of infinitely many QDLP languages. This family is carefully studied and the set of QDLP languages which generalize traditional DLP is precisely singled out. Algorithms for computing the minimal models of quantitative programs are proposed.

#!This paper addresses culturally rooted factors within user interface design. The design implications of globalisation are discussed, together with the related processes of internationalisation, localisation, 'glocalisation', iconisation and culturalisation, in order to establish a basis for a new approach to HCI design. The potential for a more diverse culture-centred, design-based system-'Culture-Centred Design' (CCD) is introduced, and a CCD process developed. A redesigned computer interface, incorporating a consistent and culturally rooted metaphor for a Chinese user target group is discussed. A culturally specific 'garden' metaphor is developed and applied as an alternative to the current global 'office' or 'desktop' metaphor. A working demonstration of the interface is piloted with a group of Chinese users to assess its success in terms of interactivity, usability and cultural significance. The overall results of the first two evaluation phases have shown very positive outcomes for the use of the CCD system and Chinese garden metaphor.

#!This work shows an object oriented library that was designed to facilitate the development of simulation studies of sawmills. A group technology approach was used to minimize the number of objects in the library, which includes objects that have the functionality of the equipments found in these facilities, so that the analyst only needs to provide the layout, locate the transports and machines, and insert the parameters of the process. For large sawmills having state of the art production equipment, with optimization capacities in each machine, two applications of the library are shown. The study demonstrates the advantage of using an object orientation, and the usefulness of simulation is a tool for aiding in both the design and in the improvement of the operations of these facilities.

#!We introduce the first algorithm that we are aware of to employ Bloom filters for longest prefix matching (LPM). The algorithm performs parallel queries on Bloom filters, an efficient data structure for membership queries, in order to determine address prefix membership in sets of prefixes sorted by prefix length. We show that use of this algorithm for Internet Protocol (IP) routing lookups results in a search engine providing better performance and scalability than TCAM-based approaches. The key feature of our technique is that the performance, as determined by the number of dependent memory accesses per lookup, can be held constant for longer address lengths or additional unique address prefix lengths in the forwarding table given that memory resources scale linearly with the number of prefixes in the forwarding table. Our approach is equally attractive for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit destination addresses, four times longer than IPv4. We present a basic version of our approach along with optimizations leveraging previous advances in LPM algorithms. We also report results of performance simulations of our system using snapshots of IPv4 BGP tables and extend the results to IPv6. Using less than 2 Mb of embedded RAM and a commodity SRAM device, our technique achieves average performance of one hash probe per lookup and a worst case of two hash probes and one array access per lookup.

In this paper, we discuss AMINES-HLA with respect to IEEE HLA standard, DEVS, and the architectures of OMNeT++ and NS-2. We describe two scenarios which demonstrate how simulation interoperability and model interreplacement can be realized through AMINES-HLA. In the first scenario, we show how a virtualized program and protocol stack can be used to replace a specific model in a simulator built on AMINES-HLA. In the context of the second scenario, we discuss how two simulators can be interoperated.

#!Computer Science (CS) students have often shied away from the field of embedded systems owing to their perception of this area as "hardware" oriented, not without reason. But recent trends in embedded systems, with the growing importance of the software component, has brought about new opportunities for computer science students to participate and contribute to embedded system development. In this paper we present our views and experience gained by teaching Computer Science students, on how we can bring embedded systems closer to them, to provide them the opportunity to fully participate in this growing field. We believe that by building on the CS students' strengths, while lessening the emphasis on the 'hardware' aspects, we can still allow them to master sufficient knowledge and skills to participate in this field.

#!Algorithms for the analysis of graph sequences are proposed in this paper. In particular, we study the problem of recovering missing information and predicting the occurrence of nodes and edges in time series of graphs. Two different recovery schemes are developed. The first scheme uses reference patterns that are extracted from a training set of graph sequences, while the second method is based on decision tree induction. Our work is motivated by applications in computer network analysis. However, the proposed recovery and prediction schemes are generic and can be applied in other domains as well.

#index4689
#!This paper presents two hardware-friendly low-power oriented fast motion estimation (ME) algorithms and their VLSI implementations. The basic idea of the proposed partial distortion sorting (PDS) algorithm is to disable the search points which have larger partial distortions during the ME process, and only keep those search points with smaller ones. To further reduce the computation overhead, a simplified local PDS (LPDS) algorithm is also presented. Experiments show that the PDS and LPDS algorithms can provide almost the same image quality as full search only with 36.7% computation complexity. The proposed two algorithms can be integrated into different FSBMA architectures to save power consumption. In this paper, the 1-D inter ME architecture [12] is used as an detailed example. Under the worst working conditions (1.62 V, 125°C) and 166 MHz clock frequency, the PDS algorithm can reduce 33.3% power consumption with 4.05 K gates extra hardware cost, and the LPDS can reduce 37.8% power consumption with 1.73 K gates overhead.

#!This paper introduces a new progressive multi-resolution approach for representating and processing polyhedral objects of any dimension. Our representation, a variant of BSP trees [Nay90] combined with the Split scheme introduced in [BP96], allows progressive streaming and rendering of solid models at multiple levels of detail (LOD). Boolean set operations are computed progressively by reading in input a stream of incremental refinements of the operands. Each refinement of the input is mapped immediately to a refinement of the output so that the result is also represented as a stream of progressive refinements. The computation of complex models results in a tree of pipelined processes that make continuous progress concurrently, so that coarse approximations of the final results are obtained nearly instantly, long before the input operands are fully processed. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of this approach with models constructed with our prototype system.

#!Recent work concerning user satisfaction shows that hedonic aspects of a user interface influence the perceived usability and attractiveness of the product. We investigate if these results can also be applied to business management software. In addition, we try to clarify the impact of hedonic aspects on user preference for different user interfaces. In an empirical study subjects judged three different user interfaces for the same business task with respect to their attractiveness by filling out the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire (Hassenzahl, M., Burmester, M., Koller, F., 2003. AttrakDiff: Ein Fragebogen zur Messung wahrgenommener hedonischer und pragmatischer Qualitat. [AttrakDiff: A questionnaire for the measurement of perceived hedonic and pragmatic quality]. In: J. Ziegler and G. Szwillus (Eds.), Mensch and Computer 2003: Interaktion in Bewegung, 187-196. Stuttgart, Leipzig: B.G. Teubner). The subjects ranked the interfaces also by personal preference. The results show that pragmatic and hedonic qualities have an impact on attractiveness. In addition, the more attractive an interface is the higher is the preference of subjects for this interface.

#*Towards on-line saccade planning for high-resolution image sensing
#@Alberto Del Bimbo,Federico Pernici
#t2006
#cPattern Recognition Letters
#index4701
#!This paper considers the problem of designing an active observer to plan a sequence of decisions regarding what target to look at, through a foveal-sensing action. We propose a framework in which a pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) camera schedules saccades in order to acquire high resolution images (at least one) of as many moving targets as possible before they leave the scene. An intelligent choice of the order of sensing the targets can significantly reduce the total dead-time wasted by the active camera and, consequently, its cycle time. The grabbed images provide meaningful identification imagery of distant targets which are not recognizable in a wide angle view. We cast the whole problem as a particular kind of dynamic discrete optimization. In particular, we will show that the problem can be solved by modelling the attentional gaze control as a novel on-line dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with deadlines. Moreover we also show how multi-view geometry can be used for evaluating the cost of high resolution image sensing with a PTZ camera. Congestion analysis experiments are reported proving the effectiveness of the solution in acquiring high resolution images of a large number of moving targets in a wide area. The evaluation was conducted with a simulation using a dual camera system in a master-slave configuration. Camera performances are also empirically tested in order to validate how the manufacturer's specification deviates from our model using an off-the-shelf PTZ camera.

#!The medial axis can be viewed as a compact representation for an arbitrary model; it is an essential geometric structure in many applications. A number of practical algorithms for its computation have been aimed at speeding up its computation and at addressing its instabilities. In this paper we propose a new algorithm to compute the medial axis with arbitrary precision. It exhibits several desirable properties not previously combined in a practical and efficient algorithm. First, it allows for a tradeoff between computation time and accuracy, making it well-suited for applications in which an approximation of the medial axis suffices, but computational efficiency is of particular concern. Second, it is output sensitive: the computation complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the size of the representation of a model, but on the size of the representation of the resulting medial axis. Third, the densities of the approximated medial axis points in different areas are adaptive to local free space volumes, based on the assumption that a coarser approximation in wide open area can still suffice the requirements of the applications. We present theoretical results, bounding the error introduced by the approximation process. The algorithm has been implemented and experimental results are presented that illustrate its computational efficiency and robustness.

#!The market of portable computational devices is expanding more and more rapidly. The systems created by the interactions of these devices among themselves and with the surrounding infrastructure result in being quite different from existing traditional systems in terms of connectivity, dynamicity and resource availability. As a consequence, existing performance evaluation and prediction techniques appear to be inadequate to the application to mobile systems. While some adaptations have been proposed for systems presenting some logical mobility (i.e., software mobility), very little has been attempted to provide useful performance prediction methodologies for physically mobile systems.In this paper we present a methodology for modeling performance of physically mobile systems: our aim is to provide guidelines for the designer of the system on how particular physical mobility patterns affect the system performance and on how these measures can be taken into account in the early stages of the system development.

Although freedom of information is generally considered desirable, there are a number of areas where there is substantial agreement that freedom of information should be limited. After a certain ordering of the landscape, I argue that we need to add the category of 'dangerous' information and that this category has gained a new quality in the context of current information technology, specifically the Internet. This category includes information the use of which would be morally wrong as well as some of what may be called 'corrupting' information. Some such information should not be spread at all and some should be very limited in its spread.

#!In this paper we proposed a novel technology to make SU-8 movable parts in situ by using PAG-diluted SU-8 or SU-8R, a SU-8 solution with no photoacid generator (PAG) content, as the sacrificial layer. Since they are not or less sensitive to UV light the unexposed bottom layer in UV lithography will be dissolved to release the movable components during the final develop in PGMEA (Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate). The use of PAG-diluted SU-8 or SU-8R as a sacrificial layer offers several advantages including significant reduction in processing steps. It becomes the simplest technique currently available for in situ fabrication of SU-8 movable parts. In this paper the lithographic sensitivities of SU-8 as a function of the PAG concentration, detailed fabrication process and examples of fabricated SU-8 movable parts will be presented.

#*A novel approach to fuzzy clustering based on a dissimilarity relation extracted from data using a TS system

#!Clustering refers to the process of unsupervised partitioning of a data set based on a dissimilarity measure, which determines the cluster shape. Considering that cluster shapes may change from one cluster to another, it would be of the utmost importance to extract the dissimilarity measure directly from the data by means of a data model. On the other hand, a model construction requires some kind of supervision of the data structure, which is exactly what we look for during clustering. So, the lower the supervision degree used to build the data model, the more it makes sense to resort to a data model for clustering purposes. Conscious of this, we propose to exploit very few pairs of patterns with known dissimilarity to build a TS system which models the dissimilarity relation. Among other things, the rules of the TS system provide an intuitive description of the dissimilarity relation itself. Then we use the TS system to build a dissimilarity matrix which is fed as input to an unsupervised fuzzy relational clustering algorithm, denoted any relation clustering algorithm (ARCA), which partitions the data set based on the proximity of the vectors containing the dissimilarity values between each pattern and all the other patterns in the data set. We show that combining the TS system and the ARCA algorithm allows us to achieve high classification performance on a synthetic data set and on two real data sets. Further, we discuss how the rules of the TS system represent a sort of linguistic description of the dissimilarity relation.

#!We present a framework for the systematic study of parametric variation in planar mechanical parts and for efficiently computing approximations of their tolerance envelopes. Part features are specified by explicit functions defining their position and shape as a function of parameters whose nominal values vary along tolerance intervals. Their tolerance envelopes model perfect form Least and Most Material Conditions (LMC/MMC). Tolerance envelopes are useful in many design tasks such as quantifying functional errors, identifying unexpected part collisions, and determining device assemblability. We derive geometric properties of the tolerance envelopes and describe four efficient algorithms for computing first-order linear approximations with increasing accuracy. Our experimental results on three realistic examples show that the implemented algorithms produce better results in terms of accuracy and running time than the commonly used Monte Carlo method.

#!This paper discusses two broad approaches for reducing the complexity of large cellular network models. The first approach involves exploiting conservation and time-scale separation and allows the dimension of the model to be significantly reduced. The second approach involves identifying subnetworks that carry out well defined functions and replacing these with simpler representations. Examples include identification of functional subnetworks such as oscillators or bistable switches and replacing these with a simplified mathematical construct. This enables complex networks to be rationalized as a series of hierarchical modules and greatly simplifies our ability to understand the dynamics of complex networks.

#!a new high-resolution upwind compact scheme is presented and analyzed, along with several previously proposed schemes, for numerical dispersion-dissipation, anisotropy, phase damping, dispersion relation preservation property and numerical stability. The schemes are tested on problems of the propagation of a initially discontinuous wave and of the transport of a sharp scalar cone. A benchmark problem of aeroacoustics is solved with the present scheme, giving satisfactory resolution. The scheme compares well with the existing schemes for the range of properties considered desirable in high resolution schemes.

#!This paper presents a framework (named Bridge_Sim) that aids contractors in planning bridge deck construction using computer simulation. The proposed framework estimates the time and cost required for construction of bridges' decks. Seven construction methods are included in the proposed framework. These are: cast-in-place on falsework, steel bridge construction, cantilever carriage, pre-cast balanced cantilever, deck pushing, stepping formwork, and launching girder method. The framework estimates total duration and cost for each zone along with its sub-zones, taking into account uncertainties inherited in tasks duration by allowing utilization probability density functions. It allows defining different options and ranges of parameters that influence the duration and total cost associated with launching girder construction method to carry out optimization analysis utilizing Ant Colony optimization. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the practical features of Bridge_Sim.

#!Time series data that can be modeled as linear combinations of weighted and shifted primitive functions such as ramps, steps and impulses are representative of many industrial, manufacturing, and business processes. Data of this type also are found in statistical process control, structural health monitoring, and other system diagnosis applications. Often, the existence of one or more of these primitive functions may be indicative of the occurrence of a specific process event, making their detection and interpretation of great interest. The human eye is an exceptional tool at this kind of pattern recognition. However, for processes that generate large amounts of data the human eye encounters difficulties related to speed and consistency necessitating an automated approach. In this paper, we consider the problem of decomposing a time series into its steps, ramps, and impulses constituents and expressing it as a linear combination of weighted and shifted versions of these primitives. We express the problem as a least squares error minimization coupled with a combinatorial search to arrive at an acceptable decomposition. We show that under certain conditions, such decomposition is possible and can be obtained efficiently using a sliding window approach. We illustrate the results with several examples.

We show that when the structuring elements are balls of a metric, locally adaptable erosion and dilation can be efficiently implemented as a variant of distance transformation algorithms. Opening and closing are obtained by a local threshold of a distance transformation, followed by the adaptable dilation.

#!In customer-driven design of systems or products, one has performance targets in mind and would like to identify system design parameters that yield the target performance vector. Since most simulation models predict performance given design parameter values, this identification must be done iteratively through an optimization search procedure. In some cases it would be preferable to find design parameter values directly via an explicit inverse model. Regression and other forms of approximation 'metamodels' provide estimates of simulation model outputs as a function of design parameters. It is possible to design fitting experiments (DOE's) that allow simultaneous fitting of both forward and inverse metamodels. This paper discusses the potential for this strategy and shows a simple two-phase DOE strategy using a maxi-min measure of DOE quality.

#!We present a decentralized authorization architecture based on capabilities in which parties are able to exercise full control over their resources and delegate it in an ad-hoc manner. In our architecture data objects are encrypted and capabilities are used to gain access to them directly. Data storage can then be decoupled from access to the stored data. Capabilities are also protected by encryption, so that they can be distributed to principals not authorized to use them. Replication and distribution can therefore be used to increase the availability not only of the data objects but of the authorization architecture itself to cope with disconnections and, in general, to adapt to changes of network topology typical of loosely coupled systems such as peer-to-peer networks and collaborative systems.

#!Whilst multimedia technology has been one of the main contributing factors behind the Web's success, delivery of personalized multimedia content has been a desire seldom achieved in practice. Moreover, the perspective adopted is rarely viewed from a cognitive styles standpoint, notwithstanding the fact that they have significant effects on users' preferences with respect to the presentation of multimedia content. Indeed, research has thus far neglected to examine the effect of cognitive styles on users' subjective perceptions of multimedia quality. This paper aims to examine the relationships between users' cognitive styles, the multimedia quality of service delivered by the underlying network, and users' quality of perception (understood as both enjoyment and informational assimilation) associated with the viewed multimedia content. Results from the empirical study reported here show that all users, regardless of cognitive style, have higher levels of understanding of informational content in multimedia video clips (represented in our study by excerpts from television programmes) with weak dynamism, but that they enjoy moderately dynamic clips most. Additionally, multimedia content was found to significantly influence users' levels of understanding and enjoyment. Surprisingly, our study highlighted the fact that Bimodal users prefer to draw on visual sources for informational purposes, and that the presence of text in multimedia clips has a detrimental effect on the knowledge acquisition of all three cognitive style groups.

#!This paper reports the results of a simulation study using Arena on a system resembling a part of the high level supporting structure of a Command and Control Center for military air operations. The system is modeled as a reconfigurable queuing network with servers that are subject to failures and with a human operator unit. The main interest is to understand and quantify the benefits of reconfiguration, and to recommend changes in structural parameters and policies for optimized network performance. An optimal control policy is applied to the main processing unit in C2. The investigation is based on a Markov decision problem with the C2 unit as a closed queuing network; where in the structure of optimal policy is accomplished by means of dynamic programming. The paper presents our modeling effort, and simulation results that compare the C2 system performance.

#!This paper addresses the problem of streaming packetized media over a lossy packet network through an intermediate proxy server to a client, in a rate-distortion optimized way. The proxy, located at the junction of the backbone network and the last hop to the client, coordinates the communication between the media server and the client using hybrid receiver/sender-driven streaming in a rate-distortion optimization framework. The framework enables the proxy to determine at every instant which packets, if any, it should either request from the media server or (re)transmit directly to the client, in order to meet constraints on the average transmission rates on the backbone and the last hop while minimizing the average end-to-end distortion. Performance gains are observed over rate-distortion optimized sender-driven systems for streaming packetized video content. The improvement in performance depends on the quality of the network path both in the backbone network and along the last hop.

This decision is usually made by an expert in industry being familiar with a variety of hardware platforms. Therefore, it is of major interest how this expert knowledge and the skills necessary for such a selection process can be taught to students. In this paper a systematic hardware platform selection process based on hardware attributes is presented. Moreover, it is proposed how to integrate this approach in the embedded systems education.

#!The dielectric properties of Al/Si"3N"4/p-Si(100) MIS structure were studied from the C-V and G-V measurements in the frequency range of 1kHz to 1MHz and temperature range of 80-300K. Experimental results shows that the @e' and @e'' are found to decrease with increasing frequency while the value of @e' and @e'' increase with increasing temperature, especially, above 160K. As typical values, the dielectric constant @e' and dielectric loss @e'' have the values of 7.49, 1.03 at 1kHz, and only 0.9, 0.02 at 1MHz, respectively. The ac electrical conductivity (@s"a"c) increases with both increasing frequency and temperature. The activation energy of 24meV was calculated from Arrhenius plot at 1MHz. The results indicate that the interfacial polarization can be more easily occurred at low frequencies and high temperatures.

#!All Western countries are taking increasing numbers of patients onto their renal programs. Physicians now accept older and sicker patients than they would have done in the past. A discrete event simulation describes patient arrivals and the transfer between three modalities of treatment for different age and risk groups in order to project future demands for treatment. In the UK, at the national level the main uncertainty arises from the expected number of new patients, which is on an upward trajectory and has not yet reached the level of most other European countries or the USA. At a local level the uncertainties are much greater because of the inherent randomness in smaller populations. In these smaller populations, simpler modeling methods that only take account of new arrivals, transplant and death rates may be equally valuable, providing that the standard deviations of the estimates can be calculated.

#!Recently, there have been a number of scheduling success stories in computer applications. Across a wide array of applications, the simple heuristic of "prioritizing small jobs" has been used to reduce user response times with enormous success. For instance, variants of Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time (SRPT) and Preemptive-Shortest-Job-First (PSJF) have been suggested for use in web servers [5, 12], wireless applications [6], and databases [8]. As a result of the attention given to size based policies by computer systems researchers, there has been a resurgence in analytical work studying these policies. However, the policies studied in theory, e.g. SRPT and PSJF, are idealized versions of the policies implemented by practitioners. In particular, the intricacies of computer systems force the use of complex hybrid policies in practice, though these more complex policies are still built around the heuristic of "prioritizing small jobs." Thus, there exists a gap between the results provided by theoretical research and the needs of practitioners. This gap results from three primary disconnects between the model studied in theory and the needs of system designers. First, in designing systems, the goal is not simply to provide small response times; other performance measures are also important. Thus, idealized policies such as SRPT and PSJF are often tweaked by practitioners to perform well on secondary performance measures (e.g. fairness and slowdown) [3, 11, 12]. Second, the overhead involved in distinguishing between an infinite number of different priority classes typically causes system designers to discretize policies such as SRPT and PSJF so that they use only a small number of priority classes (5-10) [5, 11]. Third, in many cases information about the service demands (sizes) of jobs is inexact. For instance, when serving static content, web servers have exact knowledge of the sizes of the files being served, but have inexact knowledge of network conditions. Thus, the web server only has an estimate of the true service demand [7, 12].

#*Linux Client Migration Cookbook, Version 2: A Practical Planning and Implementation Guide for Migrating to Desktop Linux
#@
#t2006

#index4847
#!The goal of this IBM Redbook is to provide a technical planning reference for IT organizations large or small that are now considering a migration to Linux-based personal computers. For Linux, there is a tremendous amount of “how-to” information available online that addresses specific and very technical operating system configuration issues, platform-specific installation methods, user interface customizations, and so forth. This book includes some technical “how-to” as well, but the overall focus of the content in this book is to walk the reader through some of the important considerations and planning issues that you could encounter during a migration project. Within the context of a pre-existing Microsoft Windows-based environment, we attempt to present a more holistic, end-to-end view of the technical challenges and methods necessary to complete a successful migration to Linux-based clients. This second version of the Linux Client Migration Cookbook builds on the content strategy we started with in the first version. Although anyone interested in using Linux on the desktop could benefit from different portions of this book, our primary audience for this book is existing business IT environments that need to begin an evaluation of desktop Linux, or in a broader sense, any organization whose strategy is to move toward greater adoption of open source software and open standards. For this version, we have completed an end-to-end refresh and have added a significant amount of new content. Some key areas that we have focused on include the following: - Greater emphasis on illustrating the technical details of the Linux client operating system stack, and understanding how to best leverage those differences in a migration scenario from Microsoft Windows - The tremendous amount of flexibility that Linux gives you to design custom client operating system images - Deployment models: Understanding how Linux's flexibility allows for new, innovative, and cost-effective approaches to deploying and managing desktop operating systems - In larger IT environments, the importance of automating the capture and migration of user's client-side personalization data The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!This paper examines a discrete material manufacturing system consisting of three machines that are subject to breakdown and one buffer of finite capacity. It is assumed that the buffer has two immediate preceding machines performing the same operations and one immediate succeeding machine receiving material from the buffer. When the buffer reaches its own capacity, one of the two preceding machines has priority over the other to dispose its processed part into the buffer.It is also assumed that there is a new way of the machines reaching failure, by allowing the machines to fail not only when they are operational but also when are either blocked or starved. The latter gives rise to the possibility of modeling the production of more than one part types. The model is solved analytically by developing a recursive algorithm that generates the transition matrix for any value C of the intermediate buffer capacity. Then various performance measures of the system (e.g., throughput) can be easily evaluated. Numerical results for the throughput are also given and these are compared against simulation. The proposed model may be used as a decomposition block to solve large flow lines with merge/ split operations (for example, flow lines with quality inspections and rework loops) and multiple part types.

#!Variations in the semiconductor fabrication process results in variability in parameters between transistors on the same die, a problem exacerbated by lithographic scaling. The re-configurability of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays presents the opportunity to compensate for within-die delay variability. This paper presents three reconfiguration-based strategies for compensating within-die stochastic delay variability in FPGAs: reconfiguring the entire FPGA, relocating subcircuits within an FPGA, and reconfiguring signal paths within a design. The yield of each strategy is analysed and compared with worst-case design and statistical static timing analysis (SSTA). It is demonstrated that significant im-provements in circuit yield and timing are possible using SSTA alone, and these improvements can be enhanced by employing reconfiguration-based techniques.

#!To even try to keep pace with the rapid evolution of game development, you need a strong foundation in core programming techniques-not a hefty volume on one narrow topic or one that devotes itself to API-specific implementations. Finally, there's a guide that delivers! As a professor at the Spanish university that offered that country's first master's degree in video game creation, author Daniel Sanchez-Crespo recognizes that there's a core programming curriculum every game designer should be well versed in-and he's outlined it in these pages! By focusing on time-tested coding techniques-and providing code samples that use C++, and the OpenGL and DirectX APIs-Daniel has produced a guide whose shelf life will extend long beyond the latest industry trend. Code design, data structures, design patterns, AI, scripting engines, 3D pipelines, texture mapping, and more: They're all covered here-in clear, coherent fashion and with a focus on the essentials that will have you referring back to this volume for years to come.

#!With more than a million dedicated programmers, Perl has proven to be the best computing language for the latest trends in computing and business. While other languages have stagnated, Perl remains fresh, thanks to its community-based development model, which encourages the sharing of information among users. This tradition of knowledge-sharing allows developers to find answers to almost any Perl question they can dream up.And you can find many of those answers right here in Perl Hacks. Like all books in O'Reilly's Hacks Series, Perl Hacks appeals to a variety of programmers, whether you're an experienced developer or a dabbler who simply enjoys exploring technology. Each hack is a short lesson--some are practical exercises that teach you essential skills, while others merely illustrate some of the fun things that Perl can do. Most hacks have two parts: a direct answer to the immediate problem you need to solve right now and a deeper, subtler technique that you can adapt to other situations. Learn how to add CPAN shortcuts to the Firefox web browser, read files backwards, write graphical games in Perl, and much more.For your convenience, Perl Hacks is divided by topic--not according to any sense of relative difficulty--so you can skip around and stop at any hack you like. Chapters include:Productivity HacksUser InteractionData MungingWorking with ModulesObject HacksDebuggingWhether you're a newcomer or an expert, you'll find great value in Perl Hacks, the only Perl guide that offers something useful and fun for everyone.

#!Recommender systems help people to find information that is interesting to them. However, current recommendation techniques only address the user's short-term and long-term interests, not their immediate interests. This paper describes a method to structure information (with or without using recommendations) taking into account the users' immediate interests: a goal-based structuring method. Goal-based structuring is based on the fact that people experience certain gratifications from using information, which should match with their goals. An experiment using an electronic TV guide shows that structuring information using a goal-based structure makes it easier for users to find interesting information, especially if the goals are used explicitly; this is independent of whether recommendations are used or not. It also shows that goal-based structuring has more influence on how easy it is for users to find interesting information than recommendations.

#!This research examines employing "Temporal Fusion" to reduce clutter confusion associated with dynamic information displays used in C2 operations. The intent here is to design timing formats to aid targeting attention and memory Eleven subjects performed an attentionally demanding short-term (ST) memory task. Two different timing formats are used to carry memory set items. Task irrelevant items are present and timed to occur either synchronously with memory set items or asynchronously. Results indicate that dynamic irrelevant information added to the display can affect recognition memory. Performance facilitation is best when task irrelevant item timing is the same as memory set timing. These data suggest application of certain timing formats may play an important role in reducing clutter confusion by guiding attention and aiding memory when processing multiple sources of dynamic information. These data also have implications when designing interfaces for modeling and simulation tools.

#!The expansion of the Panama Canal could be the largest project attempted by the Republic of Panama in its 100 years of existence. The objective of this simulation study is to use the Canal Expansion project to develop and demonstrate how more precise and applied concepts involving the complex decision making processes can be used in large "system of systems". It is an attempt to explain the decision making process for complex systems, and to develop a model that will help with the political, social and economic decision making processes involved in this very large project. Challenges involved in this research initiative included developing the parametric expressions that explain the dynamical intricacies and validation of the expansion project. A hybrid system is also proposed by using different types of simulation and mechanisms such as neural networks to incorporate some of the societal/political parameters.

#!Automotive electrical and electronic systems have become very sophisticated in a relatively short time. This complexity has both led to the increased need for design analysis tools and the need for these tools to deal with more complex components. Qualitative simulation of electrical circuits has proven to be invaluable in the development of several design analysis techniques and the ability to build qualitative models for complex components has become essential to allow effective use of these tools.We have addressed the need to model complex electrical components by developing abstract representations for the behaviour to supplement the qualitative electrical simulation. This development has been carried out in two stages. In the first stage we provide the ability to include dependencies between the electrical activity in one part of a component and the (qualitative) resistance values in another. This approach is known as QCAT (Qualitative Circuit Analysis Tool), an early version of which is documented in {PughSnooke96} and has been implemented in the industrially used FMEA tool, Autosteve. The second stage (QCAT&dash;SB) uses state based descriptions to allow more complex behaviour descriptions including temporal specifications. QCAT&dash;SB will be included in the next release of Autosteve.

This paper presents a set of tools and interfaces for interacting with such a system, and a discussion of the underlying Reader system, the reading component of the Learning Reader project. The interfaces presented provide direct feedback about what portions of the text are understood, and what interpretations are being produced from it. In addition tools are presented to, among other things, provide example sentences, to facilitate users producing simplified English text suitable for the Reader.

#!We present an adaptive coupled level-set/volume-of-fluid (ACLSVOF) method for interfacial flow simulations on unstructured triangular grids. At each time step, we evolve both the level set function and the volume fraction. The level set function is evolved by solving the level set advection equation using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The volume fraction advection is performed using a Lagrangian-Eulerian method. The interface is reconstructed based on both the level set and the volume fraction information. In particular, the interface normal vector is calculated from the level set function while the line constant is determined by enforcing mass conservation based on the volume fraction. Different from previous works, we have developed an analytic method for finding the line constant on triangular grids, which makes interface reconstruction efficient and conserves volume of fluid exactly. The level set function is finally reinitialized to the signed distance to the reconstructed interface. Since the level set function is continuous, the normal vector calculation is easy and accurate compared to a classic volume-of-fluid method, while tracking the volume fraction is essential for enforcing mass conservation. The method is also coupled to a finite element based Stokes flow solver. The code validation shows that our method is second order and mass is conserved very accurately. In addition, owing to the adaptive grid algorithm we can resolve complex interface changes and interfaces of high curvature efficiently and accurately.

#!As a result of the growing demand for accurate and reliable personal authentication, biometric recognition, a substitute for or complement to existing authentication technologies, has attracted considerable attention. It has recently been reported that, along with its variants, BioHashing, a new technique that combines biometric features and a tokenized (pseudo-) random number (TRN), has achieved perfect accuracy, having zero equal error rates (EER) for faces, fingerprints and palmprints. There are, however, anomalies in this approach. These are identified in this paper, in which we systematically analyze the details of the approach and conclude that the claim of having achieved a zero EER is based upon an impractical hidden assumption. We simulate the claimants' experiments and find that it is not possible to achieve their reported performance without the hidden assumption and that, indeed, the results are worse than when using the biometric alone.

#!The semiconductor manufacturing process is usually divided in two parts: frontend and backend. In contrast to the frontend, where the manufacturing process is dominated by cluster-tools and cyclic routes, the backend has a predominant linear structure. In contrast to the frontend flow which is mostly controlled by dispatch rules, the backend process is suitable for real scheduling. A scheduling system for the backend of Infineon Technologies Dresden based on a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) system was developed and tested in the real industrial environment. The simulation model is automatically generated from the databases of the manufacturer. The system is used for short term scheduling - from one shift up to one week. The paper will focus on the aspect of optimizing the process flow and calculating exact release dates for lots. The basic principles are applicable not only in the semiconductor industry but also in other industrial sectors.

#!Extensive amounts of knowledge and data stored in medical databases request the development of specialized tools for storing and accessing of data, data analysis, and effective use of stored knowledge and data. This paper focuses on methods and tools for intelligent data analysis, aimed at narrowing the increasing gap between data gathering and data comprehension. The paper sketches the history of research that led to the development of current intelligent data analysis techniques, discusses the need for intelligent data analysis in medicine, and proposes a classification of intelligent data analysis methods. The main scope of the paper are machine learning and temporal abstraction methods and their application in medical diagnosis. A selection of methods and diagnostic domains is presented, and the performance and usefulness of approaches discussed. The paper concludes with the evaluation of selected intelligent data analysis methods and their applicability in medical diagnosis.

#!Layered manufacturing is a technology that allows physical prototypes of three-dimensional(3D) models to be built directly from their digital representation, as a stack of two-dimensional(2D) layers. A key design problem here is the choice of a suitable direction in which the digital model should be oriented and built so as to minimize the area of contact between the prototype and temporary support structures that are generated during the build. Devising an efficient algorithm for computing such a direction has remained a difficult problem for quite some time. In this paper, a suite of efficient and practical heuristics is presented for estimating the minimum contact area. Also given is a technique for evaluating the quality of the estimate provided by any heuristic, which does not require knowledge of the (unknown and hard-to-compute) optimal solution; instead, it provides an indirect upper bound on the quality of the estimate via two relatively easy-to-compute quantities. The algorithms are based on various techniques from computational geometry, such as ray-shooting, convex hulls, boolean operations on polygons, and spherical arrangements, and have been implemented and tested. Experimental results on a wide range of real-world models show that the heuristics perform quite well in practice.

#!The IT industry is beginning to mirror a trend of specialization and outsourcing that has been present for decades in other industries, such as the automotive industry. We are beginning to see the emergence of specialist service providers, such as CRM services and market places, payment and settlement services, bill presentment services and many others. Organizations increasingly use these services in complex enterprise application systems using web service infrastructures. Unlike the automotive industry, however, the IT industry does not yet have an agreed way to manage web service quality. In this talk, I will focus on managing the service quality of web services that are used across organizational boundaries. I discuss the systematic definition of formal service level agreement languages that support the precise definition of service quality, such as latency, throughput, availability and reliability. I present how service level agreements written in these languages can be used and describe how service level agreements can be policed. I conclude the talk by sketching further research that is necessary before we have a similar grip on quality as other engineering disciplines.

#!Written by Microsoft software legend Juval Lowy, Programming WCF Services is the authoritative introduction to Microsoft's new, and some say revolutionary, unified platform for developing service-oriented applications (SOA) on Windows. Relentlessly practical, the book delivers insight, not documentation, to teach developers what they need to know to build the next generation of SOAs.After explaining the advantages of service-orientation for application design and teaching the basics of how to develop SOAs using WCF, the book shows how you can take advantage of built-in features such as service hosting, instance management, asynchronous calls, synchronization, reliability, transaction management, disconnected queued calls and security to build best in class applications. Programming WCF Services focuses on the rationale behind particular design decisions, often shedding light on poorly-documented and little-understood aspects of SOA development. Developers and architects will learn not only the "how" of WCF programming, but also relevant design guidelines, best practices, and pitfalls. Original techniques and utilities provided by the author throughout the book go well beyond anything that can be found in conventional sources.Based on experience and insight gained while taking part in the strategic design of WCF and working with the team that implemented it, Programming WCF Services provides experienced working professionals with the definitive work on WCF. Not only will this book make you a WCF expert, it will make you a better software engineer. It's the Rosetta Stone of WCF.

#!Automated dialogue systems delivered over the telephone offer a promising approach to delivering health-related interventions to populations of individuals at low-cost. Over the past two decades, an automated telephone system called Telephone-Linked Care or TLC has been successfully designed and evaluated by the authors and their colleagues. This work has resulted in over twenty systems for various health-related conditions and lifestyle behaviors. This paper describes our approach to developing and writing dialogue for these automated telephone systems, including determining the program objectives, defining the target population, and selecting a theory of behavior change to guide the intervention. Both macro and micro issues are considered in constructing dialogue systems that are engaging for the target population, easy to use, and effective at promoting positive health behaviors and outcomes.

#!Progresses made on content-based image retrieval have reactivated the research on image analysis and a number of similarity-based methods have been established to assess the similarity between images. In this paper, the content-based approach is extended towards the problem of image collection summarization and comparison. For these purposes we propose to carry out clustering analysis on visual features using self-organizing maps, and then evaluate their similarity using a few dissimilarity measures implemented on the feature maps. The effectiveness of these dissimilarity measures is then examined with an empirical study.

#!In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate the worst-case response time (WCRT) of each task in a preemptive multitasking single-processor real-time system utilizing an L1 cache. The approach combines intertask cache-eviction analysis and intratask cache-access analysis to estimate the number of cache lines that can possibly be evicted by the preempting task and also be accessed again by the preempted task after preemptions (thus requiring the preempted task to reload the cache line(s)). This cache-reload delay caused by preempting task(s) is then incorporated into WCRT analysis. Three sets of applications with up to six concurrent tasks running are used to test our approach. The experimental results show that our approach can tighten the WCRT estimate by up to 32&percnt; (1.4X) over prior state-of-the-art.

#!Knudsen and Meier applied the χ2-attack to RC6. The χ2-attack recovers a key by using high correlations measured by χ2-value. Up to the present, the success probability of any χ2-attack has not been evaluated theoretically without using experimental results. In this paper, we discuss the success probability of χ2-attack and give the theorem that evaluates the success probability without using any experimental result, for the first time. We make sure the accuracy of our theorem by demonstrating it on both 4-round RC6 without post-whitening and 4-round RC6-8. We also evaluate the security of RC6 theoretically and show that a variant of the χ2-attack is faster than an exhaustive key search for the 192-bit-key and 256-bit-key RC6 with up to 16 rounds. As a result, we succeed in answering such an open question that a variant of the χ2-attack can be used to attack RC6 with 16 or more rounds.

This paper demonstrates the application of the DEVS framework for construction simulation through a simple, but representative real world application. The application focuses on analyzing the work flow between various trade contractors in production home building. The software tool 'DEVSJAVA' is used for modeling and simulation of the construction application. DEVSJAVA is object oriented; it implements the DEVS framework using Java programming language. This paper consists of three main components: an overview of the state-of-the-art in construction simulation methods and tools, an introduction to the DEVS framework, and a detailed construction example to highlight the application of DEVS framework.

#!This comprehensive guide shows you how to master the most important changes to Java since it was first released. Generics and the greatly expanded collection libraries have tremendously increased the power of Java 5 and Java 6. But they have also confused many developers who haven't known how to take advantage of these new features. Java Generics and Collections covers everything from the most basic uses of generics to the strangest corner cases. It teaches you everything you need to know about the collections libraries, so you'll always know which collection is appropriate for any given task, and how to use it.Topics covered include:Fundamentals of generics: type parameters and generic methodsOther new features: boxing and unboxing, foreach loops, varargsSubtyping and wildcardsEvolution not revolution: generic libraries with legacy clients and generic clients with legacy librariesGenerics and reflectionDesign patterns for genericsSets, Queues, Lists, Maps, and their implementationsConcurrent programming and thread safety with collectionsPerformance implications of different collectionsGenerics and the new collection libraries they inspired take Java to a new level. If you want to take your software development practice to a new level, this book is essential reading.Philip Wadler is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, where his research focuses on the design of programming languages. He is a co-designer of GJ, work that became the basis for generics in Sun's Java 5.0.Maurice Naftalin is Technical Director at Morningside Light Ltd., a software consultancy in the United Kingdom. He has most recently served as an architect and mentor at NSB Retail Systems plc, and as the leader of the client development team of a major UK government social service system."A brilliant exposition of generics. By far the best book on the topic, it provides a crystal clear tutorial that starts with the basics and ends leaving the reader with a deep understanding of both the use and design of generics."

#!Computer Sciences (CS) are having a major impact on recent scientific developments. As any other basic science, the CS is publicly perceived as an open and free science that is trying to make progress in any possible direction, resolving scientific problems in its arena and dealing with pure scientific and issues and theoretical questions per se. In this paper I claim that this is not the case. CS is heavily controlled by commercial forces, which dictate its progress, goals and future directions. The new developments in the CS arena are in most cases the result of the market needs. Several research projects at the universities are funded by the industry, dealing with issues with a clear industrial aspect. Public funds, such as the 6th European Framework project allocates a major portion of their funds for industrial research. The IEEE and ACM, the most respectful technology organizations of the CS, are governed by the industry and the universities at about equal share. The industry is holding patent rights for several CS research results, and CS scientists are issuing patents for their research because it may have a significant economic value. The CS is not an open science, in terms of Popper definition.

#@Brahim Hnich

#index5100
#!We introduce function variables to constraint programs (CP), variables whose values are one of (exponentially many) possible functions between two sets. Such variables are useful for modelling problems from domains such as configuration, planning, scheduling, etc. We show that a function variable can be mapped into different representations in terms of integer and set variables, and illustrate how to map constraints stated on a function variable into constraints on integer and set variables. As a result, a constraint model expressed using function variables allows for the generation of alternate CP models. Furthermore, we present an extensive theoretical comparison of models of problems involving injective functions supported by asymptotic and empirical studies. Finally, we present and evaluate a practical modelling tool that is based on a high-level language that supports function variables. The tool helps users explore different alternate CP models starting from a function model that is easy to develop, understand, and maintain.

#!Growth of performance sensitive applications, such as voice and multimedia, has led to widespread adoption of resource virtualization by a variety of service providers (xSPs). For instance, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) increasingly differentiate their offerings by means of customized services, such as virtual private networks (VPN) with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees or QVPNs. Similarly Storage Service Providers (SSPs) use storage area networks (SAN)/network attached storage (NAS) technology to provision virtual disks with QoS guarantees or QVDs. The key challenge faced by these xSPs is to maximize the number of virtual resource units they can support by exploiting the statistical multiplexing nature of the customers' input request load.While a number of measurement-based admission control algorithms utilize statistical multiplexing along the bandwidth dimension, they do not satisfactorily exploit statistical multiplexing along the delay dimension to guarantee distinct per-virtual-unit delay bounds. This article presents Delay Distribution Measurement (DDM) based admission control algorithm, the first measurement-based approach that effectively exploits statistical multiplexing along the delay dimension. In other words, DDM exploits the well-known fact that the actual delay experienced by most service requests (packets or disk I/O requests) for a virtual unit is usually far smaller than its worst-case delay bound requirement because multiple virtual units rarely send request bursts at the same time. Additionally, DDM supports virtual units with distinct probabilistic delay guarantees---virtual units that can tolerate more delay violations can reserve fewer resources than those that tolerate less, even though they require the same delay bound. Comprehensive trace-driven performance evaluation of QVPNs (using Voice over IP traces) and QVDs (using video stream, TPC-C, and Web search I/O traces) shows that, when compared to deterministic admission control, DDM can potentially increase the number of admitted virtual units (and resource utilization) by up to a factor of 3.

#!In this paper, we present a fast and versatile algorithm which can rapidly perform a variety of nearest neighbor searches. Efficiency improvement is achieved by utilizing the distance lower bound to avoid the calculation of the distance itself if the lower bound is already larger than the global minimum distance. At the preprocessing stage, the proposed algorithm constructs a lower bound tree (LB-tree) by agglomeratively clustering all the sample points to be searched. Given a query point, the lower bound of its distance to each sample point can be calculated by using the internal node of the LB-tree. To reduce the amount of lower bounds actually calculated, the winner-update search strategy is used for traversing the tree. For further efficiency improvement, data transformation can be applied to the sample and the query points. In addition to finding the nearest neighbor, the proposed algorithm can also (i) provide the k-nearest neighbors progressively; (ii) find the nearest neighbors within a specified distance threshold; and (iii) identify neighbors whose distances to the query are sufficiently close to the minimum distance of the nearest neighbor. Our experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm can save substantial computation, particularly when the distance of the query point to its nearest neighbor is relatively small compared with its distance to most other samples (which is the case for many object recognition problems).

#!This paper focuses on Pareto control in multi-objective dynamic scheduling of a stepper machine that is considered as a bottleneck machine in the semiconductor wafer fabrication process. We propose the use of compromise programming method for achieving Pareto control in the needs of conflicting objectives such as mean cycle time, cycle time variance and maximum tardiness. Using conjunctive simulated scheduling, at each decision instance in simulated time, a Pareto job is selected and loaded on the machine for processing. Using the real factory data, we demonstrate the concept of Pareto control in dynamic scheduling and show how a stepper machine can be controlled at specified needs of scheduling objectives. The results obtained from Pareto control approach are superior to the simulated results of actual operating heuristic in the factory.

#!Emerging needs in transportation network modeling and simulation are raising new challenges with respect to scalability of network size and vehicular traffic intensity, speed of simulation for simulation-based optimization, and fidelity of vehicular behavior for accurate capture of event phenomena. Parallel execution is warranted to sustain the required detail, size and speed. However, few parallel simulators exist for such applications, partly due to the challenges underlying their development. Moreover, many simulators are based on time-stepped models, which can be computationally inefficient for the purposes of modeling evacuation traffic. Here an approach is presented to designing a simulator with memory and speed efficiency as the goals from the outset, and, specifically, scalability via parallel execution. The design makes use of discrete event modeling techniques as well as parallel simulation methods. Our simulator, called SCATTER, is being developed, incorporating such design considerations. Preliminary performance results are presented on benchmark road networks, showing scalability to one million vehicles simulated on one processor.

#!When Microsoft made Visual Basic into an object-oriented programming language, millions of VB developers resisted the change to the .NET platform. Now, after integrating feedback from their customers and creating Visual Basic 2005, Microsoft finally has the right carrot. Visual Basic 2005 offers the power of the .NET platform, yet restores the speed and convenience of Visual Basic. Accordingly, we've revised the classic in a Nutshell guide to the Visual Basic language to cover the Visual Basic 2005 version and all of its new features. Unlike other books on the subject, Visual Basic 2005 in a Nutshell, 3rd Edition doesn't assume you're a novice. It's a detailed, professional reference to the Visual Basic language-a reference that you can use to jog your memory about a particular language element or parameter. It'll also come in handy when you want to make sure that there isn't some "gotcha" you've overlooked with a particular language feature.The book is divided into three major parts: Part I introduces the main features and concepts behind Visual Basic programming; Part II thoroughly details all the functions, statements, directives, objects, and object members that make up the Visual Basic language; and Part III contains a series of helpful appendices. Some of the new features covered include Generics, a convenient new library called My Namespace, and the operators used to manipulate data in Visual Basic.No matter how much experience you have programming with Visual Basic, you want Visual Basic 2005 in a Nutshell, 3rd Edition close by, both as a standard reference guide and as a tool for troubleshooting and identifying programming problems.

#index5165
#!As one of the most widely used desktop applications ever created, Excel is familiar to just about everyone with a computer and a keyboard. Yet most of us don't know the full extent of what Excel can do, mostly because of its recent growth in power, versatility, and complexity. The truth is that there are many ways Excel can help make your job easier-beyond calculating sums and averages in a standard spreadsheet. Analyzing Business Data with Excel shows you how to solve real-world business problems by taking Excel's data analysis features to the max. Rather than focusing on individual Excel functions and features, the book keys directly on the needs of business users. Most of the chapters start with a business problem or question, and then show you how to create pointed spreadsheets that address common data analysis issues. Aimed primarily at experienced Excel users, the book doesn't spend much time on the basics. After introducing some necessary general tools, it quickly moves into more specific problem areas, such as the following: Statistics Pivot tables Workload forecasting Modeling Measuring quality Monitoring complex systems Queuing Optimizing Importing data If you feel as though you're getting shortchanged by your overall application of Excel, Analyzing Business Data with Excel is just the antidote. It addresses the growing Excel data analysis market head on. Accountants, managers, analysts, engineers, and supervisors-one and all-will learn how to turn Excel functionality into actual solutions for the business problems that confront them.

#!The problem is sequential association of combat ID declarations in the multi-target environment. Being random and non-specific, the combat ID declarations are represented by belief functions and manipulated using the tools of the belief function theory as interpreted by the transferable belief model (TBM). The solution is provided in the framework of ''object to ID declaration'' association based on assignment techniques. For that purpose, the paper derives the global cost of assignment (i.e. a dissimilarity measure) based on the plausibility of the global assignment. This measure is directly related to the conflict as described in the TBM. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations and a comparison with various alternative dissimilarity measures is carried out in the framework of multi-object classification.

#index5185
#!Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool for manipulating text and data. They are now standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB.NET and C# (and any language using the .NET Framework), PHP, and MySQL. If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all you need to know about regular expressions, this book is a stunning eye-opener.As this book shows, a command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Regular expressions allow you to code complex and subtle text processing that you never imagined could be automated. Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation. They can be used to craft elegant solutions to a wide range of problems. Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of your toolkit. You will wonder how you ever got by without them.Yet despite their wide availability, flexibility, and unparalleled power, regular expressions are frequently underutilized. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary. Mastering Regular Expressions will help you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert and help you optimize your use of regular expressions.Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition, now includes a full chapter devoted to PHP and its powerful and expressive suite of regular expression functions, in addition to enhanced PHP coverage in the central "core" chapters. Furthermore, this edition has been updated throughout to reflect advances in other languages, including expanded in-depth coverage of Sun's java.util.regex package, which has emerged as the standard Java regex implementation.Topics include:A comparison of features among different versions of many languages and toolsHow the regular expression engine worksOptimization (major savings available here!)Matching just what you want, but not what you don't wantSections and chapters on individual languagesWritten in the lucid, entertaining tone that makes a complex, dry topic become crystal-clear to programmers, and sprinkled with solutions to complex real-world problems, Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition offers a wealth information that you can put to immediate use.Reviews of this new edition and the second edition: "There isn't a better (or more useful) book available on regular expressions." --Zak Greant, Managing Director, eZ Systems"A real tour-de-force of a book which not only covers the mechanics of regexes in extraordinary detail but also talks about efficiency and the use of regexes in Perl, Java, and .NET...If you use regular expressions as part of your professional work (even if you already have a good book on whatever language you're programming in) I would strongly recommend this book to you." --Dr. Chris Brown, Linux Format"The author does an outstanding job leading the reader from regex novice to master. The book is extremely easy to read and chock full of useful and relevant examples...Regular expressions are valuable tools that every developer should have in their toolbox. Mastering Regular Expressions is the definitive guide to the subject, and an outstanding resource that belongs on every programmer's bookshelf. Ten out of Ten Horseshoes." --Jason Menard, Java Ranch

#!A space-time discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is presented. We explain the space-time setting, derive the weak formulation and discuss our choices for the numerical fluxes. The resulting numerical method allows local grid adaptation as well as moving and deforming boundaries, which we illustrate by computing the flow around a 3D delta wing on an adapted mesh and by simulating the dynamic stall phenomenon of a 2D airfoil in rapid pitch-up maneuver.

#!In this paper we report preliminary findings from two user studies that on the one hand investigate how prosodic parameters of synthetic speech can influence the perceived impression of the speakers personality and on the other hand explores if and how people attribute personality to objects such as typical products of daily shopping. The results show that a) prosodic parameters have a strong influence on the perceived personality and can be partially used to achieve a desired impression and b) that subjects clearly attribute personalities to products. Both findings encourage us to continue our work on a dialogue shell for talking products.

#*ProteomeCommons.org IO Framework: reading and writing multiple proteomics data formats
#@J. A. Falkner,J. W. Falkner,P. C. Andrews

#cBioinformatics
#index5193
#!Motivation: Effective use of proteomics data, specifically mass spectrometry data, relies on the ability to read and write the many mass spectrometer file formats. Even with mass spectrometer vendor-specific libraries and vendor-neutral file formats, such as mzXML and mzData it can be difficult to extract raw data files in a form suitable for batch processing and basic research. Introduced here are the ProteomeCommons.org Input and Output Framework, abbreviated to IO Framework, which is designed to abstractly represent mass spectrometry data. This project is a public, open-source, free-to-use framework that supports most of the mass spectrometry data formats, including current formats, legacy formats and proprietary formats that require a vendor-specific library in order to operate. The IO Framework includes an on-line tool for non-programmers and a set of libraries that developers may use to convert between various proteomics file formats. Availability: The current source-code and documentation for the ProteomeCommons.org IO Framework is freely available at http://www.proteomecommons.org/current/531/ Contact: jfalkner@umich.edu

#!Composition of mappings between schemas is essential to support schema evolution, data exchange, data integration, and other data management tasks. In many applications, mappings are given by embedded dependencies. In this article, we study the issues involved in composing such mappings. Our algorithms and results extend those of Fagin et al. [2004], who studied the composition of mappings given by several kinds of constraints. In particular, they proved that full source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies (tgds) are closed under composition, but embedded source-to-target tgds are not. They introduced a class of second-order constraints, SO tgds, that is closed under composition and has desirable properties for data exchange. We study constraints that need not be source-to-target and we concentrate on obtaining (first-order) embedded dependencies. As part of this study, we also consider full dependencies and second-order constraints that arise from Skolemizing embedded dependencies. For each of the three classes of mappings that we study, we provide: (a) an algorithm that attempts to compute the composition; and (b) sufficient conditions on the input mappings which guarantee that the algorithm will succeed. In addition, we give several negative results. In particular, we show that full and second-order dependencies that are not limited to be source-to-target are not closed under composition (for the latter, under the additional restriction that no new function symbols are introduced). Furthermore, we show that determining whether the composition can be given by these kinds of dependencies is undecidable.

#!The test-cover problem asks for the minimal number of tests needed to uniquely identify a disease, infection, etc. A collection of branch-and-bound algorithms was proposed by De Bontridder et al. [2002]. Based on their work, we introduce several improvements that are compatible with all techniques described in De Bontridder et al. [2002] and the more general setting of weighted test-cover problems. We present a faster data structure, cost-based variable fixing, and adapt well-known set-covering techniques, including Lagrangian relaxation and upper-bound heuristics. The resulting algorithm solves benchmark instances up to 10 times faster than the former approach and up to 100 times faster than a general MIP solver.

#!Mobility modeling is important in wireless and mobile networking research due to the fact that few real large scale networks is available for performance evaluation. While existing models only take the geographical movements into consideration, we emphasize in our model the importance of human's social roles. We use a person's social activities to drive and model a node's movements. In this paper, we propose an agenda based mobility model which combine both the social activities and the geographic movements. In the design, we use a constructive modeling approach to allow the model to well conform to the real world and to be easy to use. According to our model, each node moves based on its individual agenda, which includes all the activities (when, where and what) on a specific day. To proceed from one activity to another, a node moves from one road address to another address. In deciding each agenda item, we use NHTS survey data to obtain activity distribution, occupation distribution and dwell time distribution. We use simulation to show the network topology generated by the model and ad hoc network routing performance impacted by the model.

#!Existing Internet protocols rely on cooperative behavior of end users. We present a control-theoretic algorithm to counteract uncooperative users which change their congestion control schemes to gain larger bandwidth. This algorithm rectifies uncooperative users; that is, forces them to comply with their fair share, by adjusting the prices fed back to them. It is to be implemented at the edge of the network (e.g., by ISPs), and can be used with any congestion notification policy deployed by the network. Our design achieves a separation of time-scales between the network congestion feedback loop and the price-adjustment loop, thus recovering the fair allocation of bandwidth upon a fast transient phase.

The fermionic formula can be interpreted in terms of a new set of unrestricted rigged configurations. For the proof a statistics preserving bijection from this new set of unrestricted rigged configurations to the set of unrestricted crystal paths is given which generalizes a bijection of Kirillov and Reshetikhin.

#!We are building an intelligent information system to aid users in their investigative tasks, such as detecting fraud. In such a task, users must progressively search and analyze relevant information before drawing a conclusion. In this paper, we address how to help users find relevant informa-tion during an investigation. Specifically, we present a novel approach that can improve information retrieval by exploiting a user's investigative context. Compared to existing retrieval systems, which are either context insensitive or leverage only limited user context, our work offers two unique contributions. First, our system works with users cooperatively to build an investigative context, which is otherwise very difficult to capture by machine or human alone. Second, we develop a context-aware method that can adaptively retrieve and evaluate information relevant to an ongoing investigation. Experiments show that our approach can improve the relevance of retrieved information significantly. As a result, users can fulfill their investigative tasks more efficiently and effectively.

#!Traditionally, a simulation-based optimization (SO) system is designed as a black-box in which the internal details of the optimization process is hidden from the user and only the final optimization solutions are presented. As the complexity of the SO systems and the optimization problems to be solved increases, instrumentation -- a technique for monitoring and controlling the SO processes -- is becoming more important. This paper proposes a white-box approach by advocating the use of instrumentation components in SO systems, based on a component-based architecture. This paper argues that a number of advantages, including efficiency enhancement, gaining insight from the optimization trajectories and higher controllability of the SO processes, can be brought out by an on-line instrumentation approach. This argument is supported by the illustration of an instrumentation component developed for a SO system designed for solving real-world multi-objective operation scheduling problems.

#!Managed DirectX was released with the latest version of the core DirectX libraries in DirectX9. It enables developers using the new .NET languages (i.e. C#, VB.NET, etc.) to develop rich multimedia applications with DirectX. Unfortunately the Managed DirectX runtime was released without adequate documentation, and developers are having a hard time figuring out the best way to write managed applications. This book covers how to use the Managed DirectX objects, how they differ from the core DirectX libraries, and how to create these rich multimedia applications in C#. It also covers in depth graphics techniques and the new high-level shader language shipping with DirectX9.

#!Visibility is a property of a programming language's memory model that determines when values stored by one concurrent computation become visible to other computations. Our work exploits the insight that in nesC, a C-like language with explicit atomicity, the traditional way of ensuring timely visibility---volatile variables---can be entirely avoided. This is advantageous because the volatile qualifier is a notorious source of programming errors and misunderstandings. Furthermore, the volatile qualifier hurts performance by inhibiting many more optimizations than are necessary to ensure visibility. In this paper we extend the semantics of nesC's atomic statements to include a visibility guarantee, we show two ways that these semantics can be implemented, and we also show that our better implementation has no drawbacks in terms of resource usage.

#!We construct a new 2-parameter family Emn, m, n ≥ 3, of self-dual 2-simple and 2-simplicial 4-polytopes, with flexible geometric realisations. E44 is the 24-cell. For large m, n the f-vectors have "fatness" close to 6. The Et-construction of Paffenholz and Ziegler applied to products of polygons yields cellular spheres with the combinatorial structure of Emn. Here we prove polytopality of these spheres. More generally, we construct polytopal realisations for spheres obtained from the Et-construction applied to products of polytopes in any dimension d ≥ 3, if these polytopes satisfy some consistency conditions. We show that the projective realisation space of E33 is at least nine-dimensional and that of E44 at least four-dimensional. This proves that the 24-cell is not projectively unique. All Emn for relatively prime m, n ≥ 5 have automorphisms of their face lattice not induced by an affine transformation of any geometric realisation. The group Zm × Zn generated by rotations in the two polygons is a subgroup of the automorphisms of the face lattice of Emn. However, there are only five pairs (m, n) for which this subgroup is geometrically realisable.

#!This paper presents a model of network failure recovery based on a scheme for reallocating bandwidth in path-oriented transport networks. We first describe the bandwidth reallocation scheme where, at specified time points, bandwidth can be switched to those routes that (possibly temporarily) value it most highly. This is done entirely according to local rules and without centralised control.We next describe our model of network failure recovery. We consider a protection switching recovery model which works with pre-established reserve-on-demand recovery routes. A reserve-on-demand recovery route allocates required resources after a failure on the working path has been detected. The bandwidth reallocation scheme is used to distribute bandwidth between the working routes before and after a failure, and between the working and recovery routes during the recovery cycle.To support the efficacy of such a system, we present a simulation model of failure recovery in a 30-node 46-link network. The simulation study reveals that bandwidth reallocation allows rapid recovery after the failure of a single link. Traffic is restarted on a recovery route within one round trip time and the recovery path attains the same Grade of Service (GoS) as its working counterpart within 0.1 call holding times.

#!We address two aspects of constructing plans efficiently by means of satisfiability testing: efficient encoding of the problem of existence of plans of a given number t of time points in the propositional logic and strategies for fnding plans, given these formulae for different values of t.For the first problem we consider three semantics for plans with parallel operator application in order to make the search for plans more efficient. The standard semantics requires that parallel operators are independent and can therefore be executed in any order. We consider a more relaxed definition of parallel plans which was first proposed by Dimopoulos et al., as well as a normal form for parallel plans that requires every operator to be executed as early as possible. We formalize the semantics of parallel plans emerging in this setting and present translations of these semantics into the propositional logic. The sizes of the translations are asymptotically optimal. Each of the semantics is constructed in such a way that there is a plan following the semantics exactly when there is a sequential plan, and moreover, the existence of a parallel plan implies the existence of a sequential plan with as many operators as in the parallel one.For the second problem we consider strategies based on testing the satisfiability of several formulae representing plans of n time steps for several values of n concurrently by several processes. We show that big efficiency gains can be obtained in comparison to the standard strategy of sequentially testing the satisfiability of formulae for an increasing number of time steps.

Long-time Mac author Sharon Zardetto Aker has the answers you need, explaining where your fonts reside, why they are there, and what to do about duplication and long Font menus. Once that's under control, you'll learn things like the ins and outs of different font installation methods; how to use Font Book to manage, validate, and organize fonts; ways of dealing with legacy Mac OS 9 fonts; and how to make the most of character-rich Unicode fonts. And to help with those maddening font problems, Sharon provides troubleshooting steps and real-world advice for solving problems fast. If you've experienced seemingly inexplicable trouble with characters displaying incorrectly, an inability to type a particular character, fonts missing from Font menus, confusing behavior in Microsoft or Adobe programs, Font Book crashing, or Character Palette misbehaving, Real World Mac OS X Fonts has the help you need. In this book, you'll find the answers to questions like these: What types of fonts can I use with Mac OS X? In what order does Mac OS X access fonts from all their possible locations? How can I figure out what characters are available in a Unicode font? How can I minimize font-related troubles when sharing documents across platforms? How do I go about troubleshooting a font problem? How do I enter special characters? How do I print font samples? How do I work with legacy fonts?

#!Voice over IP (VoIP) is a key enabling technology for migration of circuit-switched PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) architectures to packet-based networks. One problem of the present VoIP networks is filtering spam calls referred to as SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony). Unlike spam in e-mail systems, VoIP spam calls have to be identified in real time. Many of the techniques devised for e-mail spam detection rely upon content analysis, and in the case of VoIP, it is too late to analyze the content (voice) as the user would have already attended the call. Therefore, the real challenge is to block a spam call before the telephone rings. In addition, we believe it is imperative that spam filters integrate human behavioral aspects to gauge the legitimacy of voice calls. We know that, when it comes to receiving or rejecting a voice call, people use the social meaning of trust, reputation, friendship of the calling party and their own mood. In this article, we describe a multi-stage, adaptive spam filter based on presence (location, mood, time), trust, and reputation to detect spam in voice calls. In particular, we describe a closed-loop feedback control between different stages to decide whether an incoming call is spam. We further propose formalism for voice-specific trust and reputation analysis. We base this formal model on a human intuitive behavior for detecting spam based on the called party's direct and indirect relationships with the calling party. No VoIP corpus is available for testing the detection mechanism. Therefore, for verifying the detection accuracy, we used a laboratory setup of several soft-phones, real IP phones and a commercial-grade proxy server that receives and processes incoming calls. We experimentally validated the proposed filtering mechanisms by simulating spam calls and measured the filter's accuracy by applying the trust and reputation formalism. We observed that, while the filter blocks a second spam call from a spammer calling from the same end IP host and domain, the filter needs only a maximum of three calls---even in the case when spammer moves to a new host and domain. Finally, we present a detailed sensitivity analysis for examining the influence of parameters such as spam volume and network size on the filter's accuracy.

#!Flooding is a basic mechanism frequently used in mobile ad-hoc networks. In its simplest form flooding is realized by letting each node rebroadcast the flooded packet exactly once. To limit the scope of a flooded data packet, the sender of the packet may use ring flooding. For this, the packet's time-to-live (TTL) field is initially set to n. As the TTL of the packet expires after n hops, it only reaches all those nodes that are at most n hops away from the original sender. Ring flooding is used, e.g., to distribute information only relevant in a certain area such as emergency messages in car-to-car networks, or to do an expanding ring search during route discovery as in AODV [2].

#!Most approaches to programming language extensibility have worked by pairing syntactic extension with semantic extension. We present an approach that works through a combination of presentation extension and semantic extension. We also present an architecture for this approach, an Eclipse-based implementation targeting the Java programming language, and examples that show how presentation extension, both with and without semantic extension, can make programs more expressive.

#!Short delivery time and the efficient management of component inventories are two crucial elements that determine the competitiveness of many contract assembly manufacturers, especially in the electronics industry. In this paper, we develop and analyze an optimization model to determine the optimal stocking quantities for components of an assemble-to-order product in an environment where demand is uncertain and the price for the final product and the costs of components depend on their delivery lead times. We provide an efficient solution procedure to solve the problem in which the manufacturer must deliver the full order quantity possibly in multiple shipments. We further extend our model to the situation where the manufacturer has the option of not delivering the full quantity but instead takes the penalty for a delivery shortage. We derive some analytical results that illustrate how different model parameters affect the optimal solution and provide useful insights for managing components in the assemble-to-order environment.

#!A new code is presented here, named Gyrokinetic SEmi-LAgragian (GYSELA) code, which solves 4D drift-kinetic equations for ion temperature gradient driven turbulence in a cylinder (r,θ,z). The code validation is performed with the slab ITG mode that only depends on the parallel velocity. This code uses a semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme, which exhibits good properties of energy conservation in non-linear regime as well as an accurate description of fine spatial scales. The code has been validated in the linear and non-linear regimes. The GYSELA code is found to be stable over long simulation times (more than 20 times the linear growth rate of the most unstable mode), including for cases with a high resolution mesh (δr ∼ 0.1 Larmor radius, δz ∼ 10 Larmor radius).

#*Quantitative evaluation of a wavelet-based method in ventricular late potential detection

#!Ventricular late potentials (VLPs) are low-amplitude, high-frequency waveforms appearing in the terminal part of the QRS complex in electrocardiogram (ECG) of patients who are susceptible to ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death, after surviving myocardial infarction. Accordingly, VLP detection presents a prominent non-invasive marker for some cardiac diseases clinically. This paper proposes a VLP detection method based on the wavelet transform and investigates its performance. In this method, a modified vector magnitude waveform is formed using discrete wavelet transform for each high-resolution ECG (HRECG) record; then, by applying the continuous wavelet transform to the QRS complex end part in this waveform, a feature vector is extracted from the resultant time-scale plot. This wavelet-based feature vector is processed by principle component analysis to reduce its dimensionality. Finally, a supervised feedforward artificial neural network, trained by a proper set of these feature vectors, is employed as a classifier. To evaluate the proposed method performance, a HRECG database consisting of the real VLP-negative and simulated VLP-positive patterns is used. In a comparative approach, different VLP detection techniques including the conventional time-domain method, developed by Simson, and some methods utilizing distinct diagnostic features are also applied to this database to investigate the capability of the proposed method in VLP analysis more completely. The results show the proposed method, employing the wavelet transform in both pre-processing and feature extraction stages, reveals high evaluation criteria (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) and is qualified to detect VLPs.

#!The large size and high complexity of security-sensitive applications and systems software is a primary cause for their poor testability and high vulnerability. One approach to alleviate this problem is to extract the security-sensitive parts of application and systems software, thereby reducing the size and complexity of software that needs to be trusted. At the system software level, we use the Nizza architecture which relies on a kernelized trusted computing base (TCB) and on the reuse of legacy code using trusted wrappers to minimize the size of the TCB. At the application level, we extract the security-sensitive portions of an already existing application into an AppCore. The AppCore is executed as a trusted process in the Nizza architecture while the rest of the application executes on a virtualized, untrusted legacy operating system. In three case studies of real-world applications (e-commerce transaction client, VPN gateway and digital signatures in an e-mail client), we achieved a considerable reduction in code size and complexity. In contrast to the few hundred thousand lines of current application software code running on millions of lines of systems software code, we have AppCores with tens of thousands of lines of code running on a hundred thousand lines of systems software code. We also show the performance penalty of AppCores to be modest (a few percent) compared to current software.

#!Most reinforcement learning models of animal conditioning operate under the convenient, though fictive, assumption that Pavlovian conditioning concerns prediction learning whereas instrumental conditioning concerns action learning. However, it is only through Pavlovian responses that Pavlovian prediction learning is evident, and these responses can act against the instrumental interests of the subjects. This can be seen in both experimental and natural circumstances. In this paper we study the consequences of importing this competition into a reinforcement learning context, and demonstrate the resulting effects in an omission schedule and a maze navigation task. The misbehavior created by Pavlovian values can be quite debilitating; we discuss how it may be disciplined.

#!Commanders' Predictive Environment (CPE) is a multi-year program that has been undertaken by the Air Force Research Laboratory to develop ways to allow commanders to better anticipate and predict the outcomes of actions of both allied and opponent forces. One objective of this program is to use intuitive and innovative visualization techniques to present known and alternative courses of action within the command center. One such technique currently under development is termed knowledge glyphs. This paper explains and defines knowledge glyphs and presents initial examples of their use. The current model for knowledge glyphs was developed with the objectives that it be internally coherent, referentially comprehensive, and explicitly linked to the visual interface elements that are most critical to commanders when selecting courses of action.

#!The spatial distributions of two species of tree result in a bivariate pattern. This pattern characterizes biological mechanism involved within a forest with the spatial localization of the trees. If we consider simultaneously two species, the main question is not to describe the marginal distribution of each species but to describe the relationship between the repartitions of the two species under study. The relationship between two clouds of points can be described in various ways and therefore many indices can be defined. Each index will give a specific information about these relationships and will greatly depends on the ecological mechanisms, i.e., the point process that leads to the observed repartition. The aim of this article is to review the leading indices in ecology and to provide guidelines for practical use. To mimic ecological situations, we simulated 13 point process that can model classical relationships between two species of trees and compute nine classical indices. The interest of the various indices are discussed. A R package for simulating the point process and to compute the indices is available on request. The package is available upon request at picard@cirad.fr or avner@inapg.fr

#!The problem of binarization of gray level images, acquired under non-uniform illumination is reconsidered. Yanowitz and Bruckstein proposed to use for image binarization an adaptive threshold surface, determined by interpolation of the image gray levels at points where the image gradient is high. The rationale is that high image gradient indicates probable object edges, and there the image values are between the object and the background gray levels. The threshold surface was determined by successive over-relaxation as the solution of the Laplace equation. This work proposes a different method to determine an adaptive threshold surface. In this new method, inspired by multiresolution approximation, the threshold surface is constructed with considerably lower computational complexity and is smooth, yielding faster image binarizations and often better noise robustness.

Alice utilizes a highly networked control system architecture to provide high performance autonomous driving in unknown environments. Innovations include a vehicle architecture designed for efficient testing in harsh environments, a highly sensory-driven approach to fuse sensor data into speed maps used by real-time trajectory optimization algorithms, health and contingency management algorithms to manage failures at the component and system level, and a software logging and display environment that enables rapid assessment of performance during testing. The system successfully completed several runs in the National Qualifying Event, but encountered a combination of sensing and control issues in the Grand Challenge Event that led to a critical failure after traversing approximately 8 miles. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!DB2 Universal Database (DB2 UDB) has long been known for its technology leadership. This IBM Redbook is an informative guide that describes how to convert the database system and applications from Microsoft SQL Server to DB2 UDB Version 8.2. This guide presents the best practices in conversion strategy and planning, an architecture overview of the two relational database systems, migration tools, and practical conversion examples. It is intended for technical staff involved in a SQL Server to DB2 UDB conversion project. We discuss, in detail, the conversion of database structure, data, and database objects including stored procedures, triggers, and user defined functions. We address SQL and application conversion considerations. Examples are used throughout the book to illustrate the conversion and to provide solutions and work-arounds for different scenarios. In addition, we provide a DB2 tools and wizard usage overview, performance considerations, and testing and troubleshooting techniques. Finally, a migration scenario using the IBM DB2 Migration Toolkit is included to show the complete migration process. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!The main contribution of this paper is an effective proof of the well-foundedness of MPO, as a term of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. This proof is direct, short and simple. It is a sequence of nested inductions and it only relies on the fact that the multiset order, restricted to a well-founded part of the base set, is well-founded. In particular, it does not require to establish preliminarily the transitivity of the relation, although we prove it as an additional property. The terms we consider are not supposed to be ground nor the signature to be finite. All the proofs have been carried out in the Coq proof-assistant.

#!This paper describes and analyses the performance of a novel feature extraction technique for the recognition of segmented/cursive characters that may be used in the context of a segmentation-based handwritten word recognition system. The modified direction feature (MDF) extraction technique builds upon the direction feature (DF) technique proposed previously that extracts direction information from the structure of character contours. This principal was extended so that the direction information is integrated with a technique for detecting transitions between background and foreground pixels in the character image. In order to improve on the DF extraction technique, a number of modifications were undertaken. With a view to describe the character contour more effectively, a re-design of the direction number determination technique was performed. Also, an additional global feature was introduced to improve the recognition accuracy for those characters that were most frequently confused with patterns of similar appearance. MDF was tested using a neural network-based classifier and compared to the DF and transition feature (TF) extraction techniques. MDF outperformed both DF and TF techniques using a benchmark dataset and compared favourably with the top results in the literature. A recognition accuracy of above 89% is reported on characters from the CEDAR dataset.

#!We propose subspace distance measures to analyze the similarity between intrapersonal face subspaces, which characterize the variations between face images of the same individual. We call the conventional intrapersonal subspace average intrapersonal subspace (AIS) because the image differences often come from a large number of persons. An intrapersonal subspace is referred to as specific intrapersonal subspace (SIS) if the image differences are from just one person. We demonstrate that SIS varies significantly from person to person, and most SISs are not similar to AIS. Based on these observations, we introduce the maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation to the problem of SIS estimation, and apply it to the Bayesian face recognition algorithm. Experimental results show that the adaptive Bayesian algorithm outperforms the non-adaptive Bayesian algorithm as well as Eigenface and Fisherface methods if a small number of adaptation images are available.

#index5428
#!This paper presents a motion-based boundary tracking method for a moving deformable object in an image sequence using a parametric active contour model. Deciding the local converging directions of the contour points is essential for correctly extracting the boundary of a moving deformable object. Thus, a new energy function for a parametric active contour model is proposed based on the addition of a directional energy term using a frame difference map to the greedy snake. The frame difference map is used to obtain motion information on an object with fast and non-rigid motion. Plus, updating rules for the frame difference map are also developed to encourage the stable convergence of the contour points. Experiments on a set of synthetic and real image sequences show that the proposed method could fully track a speedy deformable object while exactly extracting the boundary of the object in every frame.

#!Haptics on 3D deformable models is a challenge because of the inevitable and expensive 3D deformation computation. In this paper, we propose a new technique that extends the conventional rigid geometry images approach proposed by Gu et al. [9]. Our approach not only flattens the geometry, but also helps to accomplish deformation in an effective and efficient manner. Our approach is suitable for haptics computing, as it performs the deformation on the geometry map itself thereby avoiding the expensive 3D deformation computation. We demonstrate construction of the deformable geometry map representation and its application utilizing practical methods for interactive surgery simulation and interactive textile simulation.

#!Companies constantly present technological developments-new materials, new mechanisms, and new ways to enhance existing products and services. Yet these seldom lead to truly new ideas. Why? Humans are all born with creative instincts, but in the interest of efficient and predictable productivity, institutions such as schools and businesses routinely hinder those impulses. The most innovative products and services, author Alexander Manu argues, arise out of the behaviors of play--the ability to imagine, without limits, the question "What if...?" Manu's engaging and inspiring book offers companies a wealth of practical advice and tactics to unleash their full creative potential and break ahead of the crowd. Manu's provocative, insightful applied methodologies for creating new business opportunities and transformative innovations gain resonance from real-world scenarios and conversations with leading innovators such as MIT's Mitchel Resnick. Readers will learn strategies to: ï¾ Open their companies' eyes to unseen opportunities ï¾ Spark the imagination and trigger the potential of product innovation teams ï¾ Turn inspired ideas into successful products and services.

Here to help designers create sites that not only work, but work well and are easy to update and maintain is an easy-to-read guide to Web programming basics from best-selling author Charles Wyke-Smith. Just as architects need to understand building materials and their properties, Web designers need to understand the code that serves as the foundation of their sites. Wyke-Smith ensures they do by teaching designers that all dynamic Web sites consist of essentially three components: a browser interface, Web server middleware, and a database. The guide covers everything from Web coding concepts and principles to building sites, designing visual interfaces, developing databases, developing middleware, ensuring a good user experience (through good code!), testing and debugging, and more. Create dynamic Web sites that provide real-time responses to user inputs Understand the basic structures of all coding languages, such as variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and objects Use the power of PHP to program the business rules of your site Learn techniques for validating forms to reject erroneous or malicious data Import and export data from other applications via at les Build and query database tables using SQL to manage the data generated by your site's activity Develop a simple content management system Develop a password-protected members-only area of your Web site Build a template-based Web site with dynamic navigation

#!These proceedings mark the fifth installment of the ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation. In the preface of the first symposium proceedings the organizers expressed their hope that SCA would be a venue focused on computer animation where the best papers in the field could be presented in an intimate and interactive setting. Looking over this and past year's proceedings, it is quite clear that their hope for SCA to be a venue of the best papers on computer animation has been realized. Further, the focused scope of SCA has consistently allowed for between 100 and 200 attendees, a size large enough to create an energetic and exciting meeting while still small enough to promote interaction between the participants.Each year SCA alternates between being collocated with ACM SIGGRAPH and Eurographics. This year SCA took place in Vienna, Austria just prior to Eurographics 2006.The 37 papers selected for publication in these proceedings were drawn from a collection of 126 submissions. The remarkable quality and quantity of these submissions made the selection process very difficult. Each paper was double-blind reviewed by four or more reviewers from our international program committee. Each of these reviewers furnished an independent opinion and ranking. Once these opinions had been collected, all the reviewers assigned to a given paper came together for an on-line discussion of that paper. In some cases the discussions were short with a quickly reached consensus. However, in other cases, discussion involved lengthly debate among the reviewers. This detailed scrutiny was, no doubt, a key factor in producing this year's collection of outstanding papers.Even among the papers that could not be accepted for publication, there were many that contained exciting new ideas. The authors of these submissions were invited to present their work as posters at the symposium. One can expect that many of this year's posters will return as papers in SCA 2007 or other high quality conferences.

Chemistry researchers and students have difficulty in analysing and comprehending molecular structure and bonding and other biomolecular characteristics. Research reports that non-speech sounds have been useful in identifying trends in gene sequences and molecular characteristics, which when used in virtual environments, can facilitate comprehension of complex relationships that are difficult to perceive through visualisation alone.

#!Identified as a strategic area, supply chain transformation plays a critical role in today's IBM business. In this paper, we introduce an effort in IBM Research Division named SmartSCOR, which provides a comprehensive framework and methodology for On-Demand SCM problem-solving based on the cross-industry process standard Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model and a variety of simulation/optimization techniques. SmartSCOR sees transformation in two different levels, from supply chain strategy design/redesign to supply chain process improvement. Supply chain strategy design/redesign transforms a supply chain in a fundamental manner by means of manufacturing and distribution network reconfiguration, value chain integration, etc. Supply chain process improvement helps align the underlying business processes to strategy setting and get them streamlined. The two levels interact with each other and result in a profound while smooth transformation. SmartSCOR has been successfully applied in two supply chain transformation projects for validation and hardening.

#!Summary: Vorolign, a fast and flexible structural alignment method for two or more protein structures is introduced. The method aligns protein structures using double dynamic programming and measures the similarity of two residues based on the evolutionary conservation of their corresponding Voronoi-contacts in the protein structure. This similarity function allows aligning protein structures even in cases where structural flexibilities exist. Multiple structural alignments are generated from a set of pairwise alignments using a consistency-based, progressive multiple alignment strategy. Results: The performance of Vorolign is evaluated for different applications of protein structure comparison, including automatic family detection as well as pairwise and multiple structure alignment. Vorolign accurately detects the correct family, superfamily or fold of a protein with respect to the SCOP classification on a set of difficult target structures. A scan against a database of >4000 proteins takes on average 1 min per target. The performance of Vorolign in calculating pairwise and multiple alignments is found to be comparable with other pairwise and multiple protein structure alignment methods.

#!We tackle the problem of validating simulation models using neural networks. We propose a neural-network-based method that first learns key properties of the behaviour of alternative simulation models, and then classifies real system behaviour as coming from one of the models. We investigate the use of multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function networks, both of which are popular pattern classification techniques. By a computational experiment, we show that our method successfully allows to distinguish valid from invalid models for a multiserver queueing system.

#!In this article, we examine the energy consumption of a set of sensors that transmit correlated information to a base station either directly or in an ad-hoc multihop fashion. Building on a single-hop distributed data rate allocation scheme, we present an efficient approximation algorithm for the NP-hard joint routing and data compression problem whose objective is to maximize the operation lifetime of the sensor networks. We prove that the performance of our algorithm lies within 1/O(log n) of the optimum value where n is the number of sensors. We use simulations to validate our intuitions and provide additional insights on the factors that impact the performance of the approximation scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme performs close to the optimum.

#!TRAC WSMR implemented several enhancements to the CASTFOREM high resolution combat model to enable analysis in support of DoD FCS Program acquisition decisions. The overall framework for FY06 FCS network analysis centers on the inherent linkage between the performance of components of the FCS C4ISR network and FCS force level outcomes. This framework suggests that the performance of the supporting C4ISR systems influences the quality of information available to the decision maker. That information drives the level of situation awareness that the decision maker achieves and the quality of the decisions published. Those decisions in turn enable the effective application of the elements of combat power and drive the observed force level outcomes.This paper describes major M&S enhancements and a methodology to assess the above linkage. We discuss CASTFOREM communications modeling and information flows, platform situational awareness (SA) databases and Common Operational Picture (COP), decision-making logic, and fusion algorithms.

#!So you've got a copy of iMovie HD and iDVD 5,ï¾ a camcorder, and plenty of footage-but how do you get all this video footage into a watchable movie? Maybe you don't wantï¾ to spend a lot of time learning all the ins and outs of the software, butï¾ just want to get your movie finished. Realizing that many users won't want to waste a single minute reading about all they can do with iMovie and iDVD, best-selling author Jeff Carlson cuts straight to the chase, using simple project-based instruction and big, colorful screen shots to guide them through the process of making their first movie on an interactive DVD. By focusing on that first project, rather than exploring every option and feature, Jeff demonstrates the quickest, easiest, smartest route to cinematic success. Each short lesson builds on the last as users learn how to shoot, edit, and produce their own movies and then distribute them on DVDs to share with friends, family, and colleagues.

#!The layered architecture of middleware platforms (such as CORBA, SOAP, J2EE) is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, layers provide services such as demarshaling, session management, request despatching, quality-of-service (QoS) etc. In a typical middleware platform, every request passes through each layer, whether or not the services provided by that layer are needed for that specific request. This rigid layer processing can lower overall system throughput, and reduce availability and/or increase vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. For use cases where the response is a simple function of the request input parameters, bypassing middleware layers may be permissible and highly advantageous. Unfortunately, if an application developer desires to selectively bypass the middleware, and process some requests in the lower layer, she has to write platform-specific, intricate low-level code. To evade this trap, we propose to extend the middleware platform with new aspect-oriented modeling syntax, code generation tools, and a development process for building bypassing implementations. Bypassing implementations provide better use of server's resources, leading to better overall client experience. Our core contribution is this idea: aspect-oriented extensions to IDL, additional code generation, along with an enhanced run-time, can enable application developers to conveniently bypass middleware layers when they are not needed, thus improving the server's performance and providing more "operational headroom".

#!This paper looks at different ways of personalising web page presentation to alleviate functional impairments in older people. The paper considers how impairments may be addressed by web design and through various personalisation instruments: accessibility features of standard browsers, proxy servers, assistive technology, application adaptors, and special purpose browsers. A pilot study of five older web users indicated that the most favoured personalisation technique was overriding the CSS (cascading style sheet) with a readily available one using a standard browser. The least favoured one was using assistive technology. In a follow-up study with 16 older web users, performing goal-directed browsing tasks, overriding CSS remains the most favoured. Assistive technology remains the least favoured and the slowest. Based on user comments, one-take-home message for web personalisation instrument developer is that the best instrument for older persons is one that most faithfully preserves the original layout while requiring the least effort.

#!Wireless sensor networks have attracted a lot of attention recently. Such environments may consist of many inexpensive nodes, each capable of collecting, storing, and processing environmental information, and communicating with neighboring nodes through wireless links. For a sensor network to operate successfully, sensors must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. This issue has been studied in wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a], both of which reach a similar conclusion that coverage can imply connectivity as long as sensors' communication ranges are no less than twice their sensing ranges. In this article, without relying on this strong assumption, we investigate the issue from a different angle and develop several necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring coverage and connectivity of a sensor network. Hence, the results significantly generalize the results in Wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a]. This work is also a significant extension of our earlier work [Huang and Tseng 2003; Huang et al. 2004], which addresses how to determine the level of coverage of a given sensor network but does not consider the network connectivity issue. Our work is the first work allowing an arbitrary relationship between sensing ranges and communication distances of sensor nodes. We develop decentralized solutions for determining, or even adjusting, the levels of coverage and connectivity of a given network. Adjusting levels of coverage and connectivity is necessary when sensors are overly deployed, and we approach this problem by putting sensors to sleep mode and tuning their transmission powers. This results in prolonged network lifetime.

#!The university team has previously developed an X-ray imaging technique that combines binocular stereoscopic imagery with motion or kinetic depth effects. The technique is designed to enhance the screening of X-ray luggage at airport checkpoints. Multiple views are produced using linear or folded linear X-ray detector arrays. The possibility of reducing the total number of arrays by synthesising intermediary views is investigated. The algorithmic approach employs eight correlation criteria which are relaxed during an iterative process. The fidelity of the synthetic images is established by comparing them with ground truth images. It is demonstrated that for each group of three arrays (in a 15 view system) a synthetic image may be employed to make the middle array redundant. This potential reduction in hardware offers important advantages for the development of a practical multiple view X-ray scanner. Limitations of the current algorithm are investigated by increasing the angular separation between the X-ray beams used to produce the perspective images.

#!The goal of this paper is to detail the integration of two "social Web" technologies - social search and social navigation - and to highlight the benefits of such integration on two levels. Firstly, both technologies harvest and harness "community wisdom" and in an integrated system each of the search and navigation components can benefit from the additional community wisdom gathered by the other when assisting users to locate relevant information. Secondly, by integrating search and browsing we facilitate the development of a unique interface that effectively blends search and browsing functionality as part of a seamless social information access service. This service allows users to effectively combine their search and browsing behaviors. In this paper we will argue that this integration provides significantly more than the simple sum of the parts.

#!In this paper, we address the problem of efficient cache placement in multi-hop wireless networks. We consider a network comprising a server with an interface to the wired network, and other nodes requiring access to the information stored at the server. In order to reduce access latency in such a communication environment, an effective strategy is caching the server information at some of the nodes distributed across the network. Caching, however, can imply a considerable overhead cost; for instance, disseminating information incurs additional energy as well as bandwidth burden. Since wireless systems are plagued by scarcity of available energy and bandwidth, we need to design caching strategies that optimally trade-off between overhead cost and access latency. We pose our problem as an integer linear program. We show that this problem is the same as a special case of the connected facility location problem, which is known to be NP-hard. We devise a polynomial time algorithm which provides a suboptimal solution. The proposed algorithm applies to any arbitrary network topology and can be implemented in a distributed and asynchronous manner. In the case of a tree topology, our algorithm gives the optimal solution. In the case of an arbitrary topology, it finds a feasible solution with an objective function value within a factor of 6 of the optimal value. This performance is very close to the best approximate solution known today, which is obtained in a centralized manner. We compare the performance of our algorithm against three candidate cache placement schemes, and show via extensive simulation that our algorithm consistently outperforms these alternative schemes.

#!The applications of radial moment functions such as orthogonal Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments in real-world have been limited by the computational complexity of their radial polynomials. The common approaches used in reducing the computational complexity include the application of recurrence relations between successive radial polynomials and coefficients. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to further reduce the computation complexity of Zernike and pseudo-Zernike polynomials based on the symmetrical property of radial polynomials. By using this symmetrical property, the real-valued radial polynomials computation is reduced to about one-eighth of the full set polynomials while the computation of the exponential angle values is reduced by half. This technique can be integrated with existing fast computation methods to further improve the computation speed. Besides significant reduction in computation complexity, it also provides vast reduction in memory storage.

#!We consider short asymptotic expansions for the probability of a sum of i.i.d, random elements to hit a ball in a Hilbert space H. The error bound for the expansion is of order O(n-1). It depends on the first 12 eigenvalues of the covariance operator only. Moreover, the bound is non-uniform, i.e. the accuracy of the approximation becomes better as the distance between a boundary of the ball and the origin in H grows.

#!This paper conducts three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear finite element analyses (FEA) to predict ultimate load behavior of slab on steel stringer bridge superstructures. This is accomplished using the commercial finite element package ABAQUS to efficiently capture the behavior of such bridges; comprehensive details of the modeling procedure are presented herein. Two composite steel girders fabricated from high performance steel (HPS) and one four-span continuous composite steel bridge tested to failure have been used to validate the proposed FEA models. These FEA results indicate excellent agreement with the experimental data.

#!Predicting the performance of a biometrics is an important problem in a real-world application. In this paper, we present a binomial model to predict both the fingerprint verification and identification performance. The match and non-match scores are computed, using the number of corresponding triangles as the match metric, between the query and gallery fingerprints. The triangles are formed using the minutiae features. The match score and non-match score in a binomial prediction model are used to predict the performance on large (relative to the size of the gallery) populations from a small gallery. We apply the model to the entire NIST-4 database and show the results for both the fingerprint verification and the identification.

#!In large-scale or evolving networks, such as the Internet, there is no authority possible to enforce a centralized traffic management. In such situations, game theory, and especially the concepts of Nash equilibria and congestion games [Rosenthal 1973] are a suitable framework for analyzing the equilibrium effects of selfish routes selection to network delays. We focus here on single-commodity networks where selfish users select paths to route their loads (represented by arbitrary integer weights). We assume that individual link delays are equal to the total load of the link. We then focus on the algorithm suggested in Fotakis et al. [2005], i.e., a potential-based method for finding pure Nash equilibria in such networks. A superficial analysis of this algorithm gives an upper bound on its time, which is polynomial in n (the number of users) and the sum of their weights W. This bound can be exponential in n when some weights are exponential. We provide strong experimental evidence that this algorithm actually converges to a pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. More specifically, our experimental findings suggest that the running time is a polynomial function of n and log W. In addition, we propose an initial allocation of users to paths that dramatically accelerates this algorithm, compared to an arbitrary initial allocation. A by-product of our research is the discovery of a weighted potential function when link delays are exponential to their loads. This asserts the existence of pure Nash equilibria for these delay functions and extends the result of Fotakis et al. [2005].

#!A reconfigurable logic element (LE) is developed for use in constructing a NULL Convention Logic (NCL) FPGA. It can be configured as any of the 27 fundamental NCL gates, including resettable and inverting variations, and can utilize embedded registration for gates with three or fewer inputs. The developed LE is compared with a previous NCL LE, showing that the one developed herein yields a more area efficient NCL circuit implementation. The NCL FPGA logic element is simulated at the transistor level using the 1.8V, 180nm TSMC CMOS process.

#!Kerdock codes (Kerdock, Inform Control 20:182---187, 1972) are a well-known family of non-linear binary codes with good parameters admitting a linear presentation in terms of codes over the ring $${\mathbb{Z}_{4}}$$ (see Nechaev, Diskret Mat 1:123---139, 1989; Hammons et al., IEEE Trans Inform Theory 40:301---319, 1994). These codes have been generalized in different directions: in Calderbank et al. (Proc Lond Math Soc 75:436---480, 1997) a symplectic construction of non-linear binary codes with the same parameters of the Kerdock codes has been given. Such codes are not necessarily equivalent. On the other hand, in Kuzmin and Nechaev (Russ Math Surv 49(5), 1994) the authors give a family of non-linear codes over the finite field F of q = 2 l elements, all of them admitting a linear presentation over the Galois Ring R of cardinality q 2 and characteristic 22. The aim of this article is to merge both approaches, obtaining in this way new families of non-linear codes over F that can be presented as linear codes over the Galois Ring R. The construction uses symplectic spreads.

#!In this paper, architectures and methods of decision aggregation in classifier ensembles are investigated. Typically, ensembles are designed in such a way that each classifier is trained independently and the decision fusion is performed as a post-process module. In this study, however, we are interested in making the fusion a more adaptive process. We first propose a new architecture that utilizes the features of a problem to guide the decision fusion process. By using both the features and classifiers outputs, the recognition strengths and weaknesses of the different classifiers are identified. This information is used to improve overall generalization capability of the system. Furthermore, we propose a co-operative training algorithm that allows the final classification to determine whether further training should be carried out on the components of the architecture. The performance of the proposed architecture is assessed by testing it on several benchmark problems. The new architecture shows improvement over existing aggregation techniques. Moreover, the proposed co-operative training algorithm provides a means to limit the users' intervention, and maintains a level of accuracy that is competitive to that of most other approaches.

#*The Digital Photography Book

#index5585
#!Scott Kelby, the man who changed the "digital darkroom" forever with his groundbreaking, #1 bestselling, award-winning book The Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers, now tackles the most important side of digital photography--how to take pro-quality shots using the same tricks today's top digital pros use (and it's easier than you'd think). This entire book is written with a brilliant premise, and here's how Scott describes it: "If you and I were out on a shoot, and you asked me, 'Hey, how do I get this flower to be in focus, but I want the background out of focus?' I wouldn't stand there and give you a lecture about aperture, exposure, and depth of field. In real life, I'd just say, 'Get out your telephoto lens, set your f/stop to f/2.8, focus on the flower, and fire away.' You d say, 'OK,' and you'd get the shot. That's what this book is all about. A book of you and I shooting, and I answer the questions, give you advice, and share the secrets I've learned just like I would with a friend, without all the technical explanations and without all the techno-photo-speak." This isn't a book of theory-it isn't full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts: this is a book of which button to push, which setting to use, when to use them, and nearly two hundred of the most closely guarded photographic "tricks of the trade" to get you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos with your digital camera every time you press the shutter button. Here's another thing that makes this book different: each page covers just one trick, just one single concept that makes your photography better. Every time you turn the page, you'll learn another pro setting, another pro tool, another pro trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. There's never been a book like it, and if you're tired of taking shots that look "OK," and if you're tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, "Why don't my shots look like that?" then this is the book for you.

At one extreme, one finds those who only see great benefits and consider the Internet a tool for freedom, commerce, connectivity, and other societal benefits. At the other extreme, one finds those who lament the harms and disadvantages of the Internet, and who consider it a grave danger to existing social structures and institutions, to culture, morality and human relations. In between one finds the majority, those who recognize both benefits and harms in the Internet as it currently exists and who recognize its usefulness while worrying about some of its negative impacts.

#!The current literature is filled with descriptions of various microprogrammed processors and discussions of the improvements in performance that can be realized through microprogramming. Thus, Tucker and Flynn [1] describe a dynamically microprogrammed processor and give several examples of problem-oriented programming in which the performance of the microcode was much better than that of assembly language code (System/360, normalized technology). Recently, Abd-alla and Karlgaard [2] have developed an algorithm for the synthesis of applications-oriented microcode for a dynamically microprogrammed computer. Their paper gives examples of problem-oriented architectures (realized through specialized instruction sets) which have much better performance than the corresponding general purpose architectures. This trend toward realizing specialized computer systems by means of writable control store probably means that more people will be writing microcode in the future. In particular, it seems worthwhile to consider the relation of the instruction sequencing functions of a given machine to both the ease of writing correct microcode and the size of control memory required for that machine. So far there seems to have been little or no discussion of this topic in the literature [3].

#!In fuzzy clustering, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is the best known and used method. Since the FCM memberships do not always explain the degrees of belonging for the data well, Krishnapuram and Keller proposed a possibilistic approach to clustering to correct this weakness of FCM. However, the performance of Krishnapuram and Keller's approach depends heavily on the parameters. In this paper, we propose another possibilistic clustering algorithm (PCA) which is based on the FCM objective function, the partition coefficient (PC) and partition entropy (PE) validity indexes. The resulting membership becomes the exponential function, so that it is robust to noise and outliers. The parameters in PCA can be easily handled. Also, the PCA objective function can be considered as a potential function, or a mountain function, so that the prototypes of PCA can be correspondent to the peaks of the estimated function. To validate the clustering results obtained through a PCA, we generalized the validity indexes of FCM. This generalization makes each validity index workable in both fuzzy and possibilistic clustering models. By combining these generalized validity indexes, an unsupervised possibilistic clustering is proposed. Some numerical examples and real data implementation on the basis of the proposed PCA and generalized validity indexes show their effectiveness and accuracy.

#!Summary: High-throughput content fingerprinting techniques employing capillary electrophoresis place new demands on the editing of fingerprint files for the downstream contig assembly program, FPC. A cross-platform software application, GenoProfiler, was developed for automated editing of sized fingerprinting profiles generated by the ABI Genetic Analyzers. The batch-processing module extracts the sized fragment information directly from the ABI raw trace files, or from data files exported from GeneMapper or other size calling software, removes the background noise and undesired fragments, and generates fragment size files compatible with the FPC software.

#!We present a virtual environment application that allows users to access embedded information within an immersive virtual space. Due to the richness and complexity of this environment, efficient and easy-to-use interaction techniques are a crucial requirement. The “Virtual Venue” seamlessly combines both twoand three-dimensional interaction techniques into a single system and utilizes previously reported as well as novel techniques that fit the task of information access. We present tools for user control of the system, travel through the environment, and information retrieval, as well as authoring tools for the creation of information-rich virtual environments. A usability study and its results are also presented and discussed. The study indicates that the use of abstract information that is tightly coupled to the virtual environment can be quite successful in enhancing the relevance of both the environment and the information. Results also show that the set of well-constrained interaction techniques presented here are usable and efficient for information retrieval.

#!Shape-from-silhouettes algorithms use either a surface or a volumetric approach. A problem with the volumetric approach is that in general we know neither the accuracy of the reconstruction, nor where to locate new viewpoints for improving the accuracy. In this paper we present a general approach to interactive, object-specific volumetric algorithms, based on a necessary condition for the best possible reconstruction to have been performed. The outlined approach can be applied to any class of objects. As an example of this approach, an interactive algorithm has been implemented for convex polyhedra.

#!Several comprehensive User Centred Design methodologies have been published in the last decade, but while they all focus on users, they disagree on exactly what activities should take place during the User Needs Analysis, what the end products of a User Needs Analysis should cover, how User Needs Analysis findings should be presented, and how these should be documented and communicated. This paper highlights issues in different stages of the User Needs Analysis that appear to cause considerable confusion among researchers and practitioners. It is our hope that the User-Centred Design community may begin to address these issues systematically. A case study is presented reporting a User Needs Analysis methodology and process as well as the user interface design of an application supporting communication among first responders in a major disaster. It illustrates some of the differences between the User-Centred Design and the Requirements Engineering communities and shows how and where User-Centred Design and Requirements Engineering methodologies should be integrated, or at least aligned, to avoid some of the problems practitioners face during the User Needs Analysis.

#!We propose an address-light, integrated MAC and routing protocol (abbreviated AIMRP) for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the broad spectrum of WSN applications, there is a need for protocol solutions optimized for specific application classes. AIMRP is proposed for WSNs deployed for detecting rare events which require prompt detection and response. AIMRP organizes the network into concentric tiers around the sink(s), and routes event reports by forwarding them from one tier to another, in the direction of (one of) the sink(s). AIMRP is address-light in that it does not employ unique per-node addressing, and integrated since the MAC control packets are also responsible for finding the next-hop node to relay the data, via an anycast query. For reducing the energy expenditure due to idle-listening, AIMRP provides a power-saving algorithm which requires absolutely no synchronization or information exchange. We evaluate AIMRP through analysis and simulations, and compare it with another MAC protocol proposed for WSNs, S-MAC. AIMRP outperforms S-MAC for event-detection applications, in terms of total average power consumption, while satisfying identical sensor-to-sink latency constraints.

#!The Web has attracted considerable attention as an avenue to improve healthcare delivery. This paper describes the development of a Web-based intervention support system (WISS) that helps provide tailored interventions to enhance health-related behavior change. The tailoring strategy is based on the transtheoretical model (TTM). The performance of WISS was assessed by a pilot study, a controlled randomized longitudinal experiment involving 366 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Results suggest that WISS can reduce MS patients' medication discontinuation rate and move more patients to a stage where dropout is least likely to occur.

#!Various situations in a massively multi-agent simulation will emerge in a simulation or the period of the simulation will become too long. These situations cause problems for system operators in that each action scenario becomes too complex to maintain and a simulation costs very long time. Therefore, flexible control of the simulation, such as changing simulation speed and switching agents' action scenarios, is required. We propose a meta-scenario description language and a meta-level control architecture. The meta-scenario description language describes how to control simulations and agents based on an extended finite state machine. Meta-level control architecture achieves control on the basis of meta-scenarios provided by a meta-scenario interpreter, which controls interpreters of agents' action scenarios and the simulation environment. In addition, our proposed architecture does not lose scalability of massively multi-agent systems for some applications.

#index5680
#!With the rapid advancements in positioning technologies such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless communications, the tracking of continuously moving objects has become more convenient. However, this development poses new challenges to database technology since maintaining up-to-date information regarding the location of moving objects incurs an enormous amount of updates. Existing indexes can no longer keep up with the high update rate while providing speedy retrieval at the same time. This study aims to improve k nearest neighbor (kNN) query performance while reducing update costs. Our approach is based on an important observation that queries usually occur around certain places or spatial landmarks of interest, called reference points. We propose the Reference-Point-based tree (RP-tree), which is a two-layer index structure that indexes moving objects according to reference points. Experimental results show that the RP-tree achieves significant improvement over the TPR-tree.

#!Lean methods have become the standard approach to the resolution of design and operational issues in production and other systems. However, the lean approach has deficiencies. The deficiencies that simulation can address are presented, discussed and illustrated. These deficiencies include modeling and assessing the effects of variation, making use of all available data, validating the effects of proposed changes before implementation as well identifying other possible improvements, and assessing the interaction effects between system components. Various industrial applications are presented that show that simulation was required to successfully address operational issues that the lean approach failed to identify and could not resolve.

#!Shipping from Yokohama to New York and St. Johns, Newfoundland is simulated by VSLAM for two routes: the Panama Canal, using fast and slow bluewater ships, and the Northwest Passage, using identically sized fast and slow Canadian Arctic Class (CAC) 3 ships. Each route is broken into a series of logical legs, and environmental conditions and wait times are assigned. Ice conditions are modeled from historical records. Average speed through the Northwest Passage shows little seasonal variation. Round trips per year are higher through the Northwest Passage for all cases in this study. The required freight rate (RFR) to recover all costs including capital recovery, is calculated for fast ships. RFR is lower for fast ships from St. Johns to Yokohama using the Northwest Passage, and higher for fast ships from New York to Yokohama. Possible future thinning of Arctic ice may improve the economics of the Northwest Passage.

#*Stephen Johnson on Digital Photography
#@Stephen Johnson
#t2006

#index5720
#!"We are in the Stone Age of digital photography. We've figured out how to make some tools, but it is just now beginning to dawn on us what we might do with them. I've often been frustrated at the concentration on the technical aspect of digital photography with so little discussion of the aesthetics and heart behind the image making. This book is essentially a distillation of what I've been teaching over the last 25 years." Master photographer Stephen Johnson has been taking beautiful landscape photography for decades, and teaching others the practical art of image making since 1977. While he started out with traditional film camera techniques, Johnson is widely recognized among his peers as a pioneer of digital photography. Stephen Johnson on Digital Photography chronicles his ride on the bleeding edge of this medium's evolution, and provides a practical in-depth introduction to digital photography that offers the latest techniques for beginning and experienced photographers alike. What sets this guide apart from other books on the topic is its approach and execution: This isn't a Photoshop book, although Photoshop has its place within the book; it's a book that a master teacher and photographer creates after a lifetime of showing others how to understand and make great photography. With 5 color photographs throughout, including black/gray duotones, and 715 illustrations reproduced with a 200 line screen, Johnson's book covers everything from: The basics of digital photography Film camera techniques vs. digital Practical approaches of the filmless photographer Techniques of the digital darkroom A photographer s digital journey Photography, art and the future This is a holistic work (and method for teaching) that embraces the state of photographic tools and techniques, blended with suggestions and experiences on why I make photographs, Johnson says. At its best, photography rides that crest where technology and art intersect. But the deepest engagement that photography can bring remains its ability to capture and hold a moment before the lens. In this age of digital manipulation, that fundamental fact must be remembered. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright © 2010 ACM, Inc.

#@Amparo Baíllo,Antonio Cuevas

#index5729
#!A major problem in statistical quality control is to detect a change in the distribution of independent sequentially observed random vectors. The case of a Gaussian pre-change distribution has been extensively analyzed. Here we are concerned with the non-normal multivariate case. In this setup it is natural to use tolerance regions as detection tools. These regions are defined in terms of density level sets, which can be estimated in a plug-in fashion. Under a normal mixture model we compare, through a simulation study, the performance of such a detection scheme for two density estimators: a (parametric) normal mixture and a (nonparametric) kernel estimator. The problem of the bandwidth choice for the latter is addressed. We also obtain a result concerning the convergence rates of the error probabilities under a general parametric model. Finally, a real data example is discussed.

#!In this paper, our approach to tackling the problem of traffic engineering in access domains is discussed. The complete solution would take into account bandwidth management, allocation, de-allocation, protection and restoration. In this work, we focus on one part of the problem, i.e. constrained routing in the MPLS access domains. We define all categories of traffic in an access domain and use CF (conjunction factor) as a figure of merit for performance evaluation of constrained routing schemes and present algorithms that control and limit CF value. The results of conducting simulations using various constrained routing algorithms are presented and conclusions are outlined.

#!In this paper, we examine how transit and customer prices and quality of service are set in a network consisting of multiple ISPs. Some ISPs may face an identical set of circumstances in terms of potential customer pool and running costs. We examine the existence of equilibrium strategies in this situation and show how positive profit can be achieved using threat strategies with multiple qualities of service. It is shown that if the number of ISPs competing for the same customers is large then it can lead to price wars. ISPs that are not co-located may not directly compete for users, but are nevertheless involved in a non-cooperative game of setting access and transit prices for each other. They are linked economically through a sequence of providers forming a hierarchy, and we study their interaction by considering a multi-stage game. We also consider the economics of private exchange points and show that their viability depends on fundamental limits on the demand and cost.

#!We present SISCO, the Simulator for Integrated Supply Chain Operations, an object-oriented supply chain simulation tool. SISCO advances the concept of a supply chain simulator in a number of ways. With SISCO, we introduce a fundamentally new approach to supply chain specification, storage, and model generation. The user specifies the structure and policies of a supply chain with a GUI-based application and then saves the supply chain description in the open, XML-based Supply Chain Modeling Language (SCML) format. SISCO automatically generates the simulation model when needed by mapping the contents of the SCML file to a library of supply-chain-oriented simulation classes. SISCO's object-oriented, agent-style system architecture and detailed output improve upon current supply chain simulation tools.

#%481213

#!In this paper we introduce a new embedding technique to find the linear projection that best projects labeled data samples into a new space where the performance of a Nearest Neighbor classifier is maximized. We consider a large set of one-dimensional projections and combine them into a projection matrix, which is not restricted to be orthogonal. The embedding is defined as a classifier selection task that makes use of the AdaBoost algorithm to find an optimal set of discriminant projections. The main advantage of the algorithm is that the final projection matrix does not make any global assumption on the data distribution, and the projection matrix is created by minimizing the classification error in the training data set. Also the resulting features can be ranked according to a set of coefficients computed during the algorithm. The performance of our embedding is tested in two different pattern recognition tasks, a gender recognition problem and the classification of manuscript digits.

#@Qing Gu,David Mendonça

#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index5782
#!Large-scale emergencies require groups of response personnel to seek and handle information from an evolving range of sources in order to meet an evolving set of goals, often under conditions of high risk. Because emergencies induce time constraint, efforts spent on planning activities reduce the time available for execution activities. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a discreteevent simulation system used for assessing how risk and time constraint can impact group information seeking and handling (i.e., foraging) during emergency response. A demonstration is given of how system parameters may be tuned in order to manipulate risk, time constraint, distribution of information and resources available for response. The results of a pilot test of the implemented system are briefly discussed. Finally, ongoing extensions of this simulation are discussed.

#!In practical applications of mathematical programming it is frequently observed that the decision maker prefers apparently suboptimal solutions. A natural explanation for this phenomenon is that the applied mathematical model was not sufficiently realistic and did not fully represent all the decision makers criteria and constraints. Since multicriteria optimization approaches are specifically designed to incorporate such complex preference structures, they gain more and more importance in application areas as, for example, engineering design and capital budgeting. The aim of this paper is to analyze optimization problems both from a constrained programming and a multicriteria programming perspective. It is shown that both formulations share important properties, and that many classical solution approaches have correspondences in the respective models. The analysis naturally leads to a discussion of the applicability of some recent approximation techniques for multicriteria programming problems for the approximation of optimal solutions and of Lagrange multipliers in convex constrained programming. Convergence results are proven for convex and nonconvex problems.

#!Biclustering or simultaneous clustering of both genes and conditions have generated considerable interest over the past few decades, particularly related to the analysis of high-dimensional gene expression data in information retrieval, knowledge discovery, and data mining. The objective is to find sub-matrices, i.e., maximal subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities over a range of conditions. Since these two objectives are mutually conflicting, they become suitable candidates for multi-objective modeling. In this study, a novel multi-objective evolutionary biclustering framework is introduced by incorporating local search strategies. A new quantitative measure to evaluate the goodness of the biclusters is developed. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate better performance as compared to existing algorithms available in literature.

#!Energy conservation is an essential property of conservative mechanical systems that should be carried over to the numerical solution. Betsch and Steinmann proposed recently perturbed potentials to achieve energy conservation in the time integration of N-body problems by Galerkin methods. In the present paper this approach is generalised to Nyström methods for Hamiltonian systems. A detailed analysis shows that energy conservation by perturbed potential functions does not affect the feasibility and (high) order of convergence of Nyström methods. Symmetry and reversibility properties are left unchanged as well. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical tests indicating clearly the benefits of energy conserving methods in long-term simulations.

#!User frustration with information and computing technology is a pervasive and persistent problem. When computers crash, network congestion causes delays, and poor user interfaces trigger confusion there are dramatic consequences for individuals, organizations, and society. These frustrations, not only cause personal dissatisfaction and loss of self-efficacy, but may disrupt workplaces, slow learning, and reduce participation in local and national communities. Our exploratory study of 107 student computer users and 50 workplace computer users shows high levels of frustration and loss of 1/3-1/2 of time spent. This paper reports on the incident and individual factors that cause of frustration, and how they raise frustration severity. It examines the frustration impacts on the daily interactions of the users. The time lost and time to fix problem, and importance of task, strongly correlate with frustration levels for both student and workplace users. Differences between students and workplace users are discussed in the paper, as are implications for researchers. or researchers.

#!The hit-or-miss transform (HMT) is a fundamental operation on binary images, widely used since 40 years. As it is not increasing, its extension to grey-level images is not straightforward, and very few authors have considered it. Moreover, despite its potential usefulness, very few applications of the grey-level HMT have been proposed until now. Part I of this paper [B. Naegel, N. Passat, C. Ronse, Grey-level hit-or-miss transforms-part I: unified theory. Pattern Recogn., in press doi:10.1016/j.patcog.2006.06.004] was devoted to the description of a theory enabling to unify the main definitions of the grey-level HMT, mainly proposed by Ronse and Soille, respectively. Part II of this paper, developed hereafter, deals with the applicative potential of the grey-level HMT, illustrated by its use for vessel segmentation from 3D angiographic data. Different HMT-based segmentation methods are then described and analysed, leading to concrete analysis techniques for brain and liver vessels, but also providing algorithmic strategies which could further be used for many other kinds of image processing applications.

#!A technique for reconstructing a class of quadric surfaces from 3D data is presented. The technique is driven by a linear least-squares-based fitting mechanism. Previously, such fitting was restricted to recovery of central quadrics; here, extension of that basic mechanism to allow recovery of one commonly-occurring class of non-central quadric, the elliptic paraboloids, is described. The extension uses an indirect solution approach that involves introducing a variable to the basic mechanism that is a function of a quadric surface invariant. Results from fitting real and synthetic data are also exhibited.

#!This paper considers image classification based on a Markov random field (MRF), where the random field proposed here adopts Jeffreys divergence between category-specific probability densities. The classification method based on the proposed MRF is shown to be an extension of Switzer's soothing method, which is applied in remote sensing and geospatial communities. Furthermore, the exact error rates due to the proposed and Switzer's methods are obtained under the simple setup, and several properties are derived. Our method is applied to a benchmark data set of image classification, and exhibits a good performance in comparison with conventional methods.

#!You may be contemplating your first Linux installation. Or you may have been using Linux for years and need to know more about adding a network printer or setting up an FTP server. Running Linux, now in its fifth edition, is the book you'll want on hand in either case. Widely recognized in the Linux community as the ultimate getting-started and problem-solving book, it answers the questions and tackles the configuration issues that frequently plague users, but are seldom addressed in other books. This fifth edition of Running Linux is greatly expanded, reflecting the maturity of the operating system and the teeming wealth of software available for it. Hot consumer topics such as audio and video playback applications, groupware functionality, and spam filtering are covered, along with the basics in configuration and management that always have made the book popular. Running Linux covers basic communications such as mail, web surfing, and instant messaging, but also delves into the subtleties of network configuration--including dial-up, ADSL, and cable modems--in case you need to set up your network manually. The book can make you proficient on office suites and personal productivity applications--and also tells you what programming tools are available if you're interested in contributing to these applications. Other new topics in the fifth edition include encrypted email and filesystems, advanced shell techniques, and remote login applications. Classic discussions on booting, package management, kernel recompilation, and X configuration have also been updated. The authors of Running Linux have anticipated problem areas, selected stable and popular solutions, and provided clear instructions to ensure that you'll have a satisfying experience using Linux. The discussion is direct and complete enough to guide novice users, while still providing the additional information experienced users will need to progress in their mastery of Linux. Whether you're using Linux on a home workstation or maintaining a network server, Running Linux will provide expert advice just when you need it.

Concepts of the implemented simulation-based optimization architecture are described, as well as how different components of the architecture are implemented. Multiple objectives are handled in the optimization process by considering the decision makers' preferences using both prior and posterior articulations. The efficiency of the optimization process is enhanced by performing culling of solutions before using the simulation model, avoiding unpromising solutions to be unnecessarily processed by the computationally expensive simulation.

#!Modern cars contain a multitude of micro controllers for a wide area of tasks. The diversity of the heterogeneous hardware and software leads to a complicated and expensive integration process.Integrating multiple tasks on fewer micro controllers reduces diversity and costs of production, but poses new problems with the growing complexity of software on a single micro controller. Therefore a more robust software development process and a safe execution environment is needed in the automotive area and other areas with similar constraints. With the KESO system we have implemented a very small and adapted Java execution environment for an OSEK/VDX operating system to address these issues.In this paper we present our approach for a low overhead OSEK/VDX system interface, which is an integral component of the KESO system. We show how access to the system services can be restricted at low cost to ensure the isolation of tasks by the use of type-safety and modern compiler techniques, while maintaining a familiar programming interface for developers that are used to OSEK application development using the C programming language.

#!The application-specific multiprocessor System-on-a-Chip is a promising design alternative because of its high degree of flexibility, short development time, and potentially high performance attributed to application-specific optimizations. However, designing an optimal application-specific multiprocessor system is still challenging because there are a number of important metrics, such as throughput, latency, and resource usage, that need to be explored and optimized. This paper addresses the problem of synthesizing the application-specific multiprocessor system to minimize latency and resource usage under the throughput constraint. We employ a novel framework for this problem, similar to that of technology mapping in the logic synthesis domain, and develop a set of efficient algorithms, including labeling, clustering and packing, for efficient generation of the multiprocessor architecture with application-specific optimized latency and resources. Specifically, the result of our algorithm is latency-optimal for directed acyclic task graphs. Application of our approach to the Motion JPEG example on Xilinx's Virtex II Pro platform FPGA shows interesting design tradeoffs.

#!Windows PowerShell, formerly know by its codename "Monad" and available now for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows Vista, and soon for Exchange Server 2007 and MOM, is the future of Windows administration. From setting up automated build environments to managing 20,000 Exchange email clients in an organization, any tool that reduces the number of repetitive steps an administrator must perform, is a real win. Even better, PowerShell part of a major Microsoft initiative that aims to replace a host of Windows management tools with a single, unified shell. This is the promise of PowerShell and the reason IT professionals need to start learning how to use it todayReflecting the best of legacy tools such as bash and the Korn shell, PowerShell also breaks new ground in its command language design and its use of the object-oriented .NET Framework. And there is no better way to learn how to put PowerShell to work than to get your hands on Monad, O'Reilly's innovative, hands-on introduction to the tool. This concise 200-page book is an exciting tour of some of the new capabilities that PowerShell puts into the hands of system administrators and power users, and is the perfect complement to existing PowerShell documentation.With more than 40 hands-on activities, the book covers every angle, from using PowerShell commands and its object-oriented pipelines to querying systems, generating reports and writing scripts that automate existing tasks. Adding to the lure is the fact that the book is written by Microsoft manager, Andy Oakley with a Foreword by PowerShell architect Jeffrey Snover-so you can be certain that it's teeming with inside information. Monad lets you see for yourself how PowerShell can significantly improve your productivity.Because the PowerShell technology has wide appeal, so, too, does this compact guide. Developers, administrators, and power users alike can all benefit from its insight. If you're someone who habitually drifts toward the c-m-d keys, knows all of the switches to most command tools, or spends time authoring batch files to solve new challenges, this book is right up your alley. And if your organization plans to upgrade soon to Exchange 2007 or MOM V3, there's no time to waste.Breaking News: A PowerShell RC1 Update to the book is now available at no charge from the book's catalog page on oreilly.com!

#!Provenance is a concept often used in the Art world to refer to the documented history of an artifact, providing information about the artifact's lineage and authenticity. Provenance-aware applications similarly allow their users to have confidence about the data they produce, and can enable users to make judgements relating to notions of trust, accountability, validation, replication and compliance of their data. PrIMe is a software engineering methodology for adapting applications to enable them to interact with a provenance middleware layer, thereby making them provenance-aware. Such applications allow users to answer questions about provenance use cases, which are descriptions of scenarios in which a user interacts with a system by performing particular functions on that system. In order to illustrate how PrIMe can make applications provenance-aware, an Organ Transplant Management example application is used.

#!A prototype reduction algorithm is proposed, which simultaneously trains both a reduced set of prototypes and a suitable local metric for these prototypes. Starting with an initial selection of a small number of prototypes, it iteratively adjusts both the position (features) of these prototypes and the corresponding local-metric weights. The resulting prototypes/metric combination minimizes a suitable estimation of the classification error probability. Good performance of this algorithm is assessed through experiments with a number of benchmark data sets and with a real task consisting in the verification of images of human faces.

#!Product conceptualization is regarded as a key activity in new product development (NPD). In this stage, product concept generation and selection plays a crucial role. This paper presents a product concept generation and selection (PCGS) approach, which was proposed to assist product designers in generating and selecting design alternatives during the product conceptualization stage. In the PCGS, general sorting was adapted for initial requirements acquisition and platform definition; while a fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm was integrated with a design alternatives generation strategy for clustering design options and selecting preferred product concepts. The PCGS deliberates and embeds a psychology-originated method, i.e., sorting technique, to widen domain coverage and improve the effectiveness in initial platform formation. Furthermore, it successfully improves the FCM algorithm in such a way that more accurate clustering results can be obtained. A case study on a wood golf club design was used for illustrating the proposed approach. The results were promising and revealed the potential of the PCGS method.

#!Operator mistakes have been identified as a significant source of unavailability in Internet services. In this paper, we propose a new language, A, for service engineers to write assertions about expected behaviors, proper configurations, and proper structural characteristics. This formalized specification of correct behavior can be used to bolster system understanding, as well as help to flag operator mistakes in a distributed system. Operator mistakes can be caused by anything from static misconfiguration to physical placement of wires and machines. This language, along with its associated runtime system, seeks to be flexible and robust enough to deal with the wide array of operator mistakes while maintaining a simple interface for designers or programmers.

#!This is the second paper of a series in which we build and study third-order Hermitian upwind schemes for numerically solving linear aeroacoustics. In this paper, we extend the method to non-stationary flows. For this purpose, we employ a family of six-wave models to discretize the space operator. This family is parametrized by an "acoustic propagation angle". From this wave modelling, specific boundary conditions are proposed to treat effectively subsonic/supersonic boundary conditions. A sequence of numerical simulations is then carried out and makes it possible to examine the effectiveness of the scheme.

#!The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is envisioned as the solution for the next generation multimedia rich communication. Based on an open IP infrastructure, it enables convergence of data, speech, video and mobile network technology. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the signaling protocol chosen by the 3GPP consortium for IMS. We propose to analyze the IMS network based on the SIP signaling delay and predict performance trends of the network, that allow us to choose parameter values optimally. The paper focuses on the formulation of queuing models for the IMS network and characterization of the SIP server workload, and on a methodology for the design of such networks for optimal performance. Our analysis is based on a careful study of real-life SIP network traffic.

#!The purpose of this paper is to estimate the demand function of mobile phone subscription in Korea, with an explicit consideration of market competition effects, and to empirically clarify the dynamic competitive relationship between the cellular and PCS services. The demand function was estimated using the Lotka-Volterra model, a famous competitive diffusion model. In addition, the characteristics of the dynamic competitive relationship in the Korean mobile phone market are empirically examined, including the existence of an equilibrium point and its stability with the estimated demand function. The results show that competitive relationship in the Korean mobile phone market exhibits a kind of commensalisms, in which the PCS market benefits from the existence of the cellular market, while the number of cellular subscribers is hardly affected by the PCS market. Furthermore, it is shown that the competition between the cellular and PCS services has a dynamic equilibrium point that is partially stable.

#index6011
#!Recent experimental researches have suggested that sustained neural activity in the prefrontal cortex is a process of memory retention in decision making. Previous theoretical studies indicate that a balance between recurrent excitation and feedback inhibition is important for sustaining the activity. To investigate a plausible balancing mechanism, we simulated a biophysically realistic network model. Our model shows that short-term depression (STD) enables the network to sustain its activity despite the presence of long-term inhibition by GABAB receptors and that the sustained firing rates have a bell-shaped dependence on the degree of STD. By analyzing the neural network dynamics, we show that the bell-shaped dependence on STD is formed by destabilizing the balance with either excessive or insufficient STD. We also show that the optimal degree of STD has a linear relationship with the neural network size. These results suggest that STD provides a balancing mechanism and controls levels of sustained activities of various size networks.

#!The push for better understanding and design of complex systems requires the solution of challenging optimization problems with large numbers of decision variables. This note presents principled results demonstrating the scalable solution of a difficult test function on instances over a billion variables using a parallel implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA). The problem addressed is a noisy, blind problem over a vector of binary decision variables. Noise is added equaling a tenth of the deterministic objective function variance of the problem, thereby making it difficult for simple hillclimbers to find the optimal solution. The genetic algorithm used&mdash;the compact GA&mdash;is able to find the optimum in the presence of noise quickly, reliably, and accurately, and the solution scalability follows known convergence theories. These results on noisy problem together with other results on problems involving varying modularity, hierarchy, and overlap foreshadow routine solution of billion-variable problems across the landscape of complexity science. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are mainly characterized by dense deployment of sensor nodes which collectively transmit information about sensed events to the sink. Due to the spatial correlation between sensor nodes subject to observed events, it may not be necessary for every sensor node to transmit its data. This paper shows how the spatial correlation can be exploited on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort which exploits spatial correlation in WSN on the MAC layer. A theoretical framework is developed for transmission regulation of sensor nodes under a distortion constraint. It is shown that a sensor node can act as a representative node for several other sensor nodes observing the correlated data. Based on the theoretical framework, a distributed, spatial Correlation-based Collaborative Medium Access Control (CC-MAC) protocol is then designed which has two components: Event MAC (E-MAC) and Network MAC (N-MAC). E-MAC filters out the correlation in sensor records while N-MAC prioritizes the transmission of route-thru packets. Simulation results show that CC-MAC achieves high performance in terms energy, packet drop rate, and latency.

#!Texture analysis has been used extensively in the computer-assisted interpretation of digital imagery. A popular texture feature extraction approach is the grey level co-occurrence probability (GLCP) method. Most investigations consider the use of the GLCP texture features for classification purposes only, and do not address segmentation performance. Specifically, for segmentation, the pixels in an image located near texture boundaries have a tendency to be misclassified. Boundary preservation when using the GLCP texture features for image segmentation is important. An advancement which exploits spatial relationships has been implemented. The generated features are referred to as weighted GLCP (WGLCP) texture features. In addition, an investigation for selecting suitable GLCP parameters for improved boundary preservation is presented. From the tests, WGLCP features provide improved boundary preservation and segmentation accuracy at a computational cost. As well, the GLCP correlation statistical parameter should not be used when segmenting images with high contrast texture boundaries.

#!Shared path protection has been demonstrated to be a very efficient survivability scheme for optical networking. In this scheme, multiple backup paths can share a given optical channel if their corresponding primary routes are not expected to fail simultaneously. The focus in this area has been the optimization of the total channels (i.e., bandwidth) provisioned in the network through the intelligent routing of primary and backup routes. In this work, we extend the current path protection sharing scheme and introduce the Generalized Sharing Concept. In this concept, we allow for additional sharing of important node devices. These node devices (e.g., optical-electronic-optical regenerators (OEOs), pure all-optical converters, etc.) constitute the dominant cost factor in an optical backbone network and the reduction of their number is of paramount importance. For demonstration purposes, we extend the concept of 1:N shared path protection to allow for the sharing of electronic regenerators needed for coping with optical transmission impairments. Both design and control plane issues are discussed through numerical examples. Considerable cost reductions in electronic budget are demonstrated.

#!Applications requiring high-speed TCP/IP processing can easily saturate a modern server. We and others have previously suggested alleviating this problem in multiprocessor environments by dedicating a subset of the processors to perform network packet processing. The remaining processors perform only application computation, thus eliminating contention between these functions for processor resources. Applications interact with packet processing engines (PPEs) using an asynchronous I/O (AIO) programming interface which bypasses the operating system. A key attraction of this overall approach is that it exploits the architectural trend toward greater thread-level parallelism in future systems based on multi-core processors. In this paper, we conduct a detailed experimental performance analysis comparing this approach to a best-practice configured Linux baseline system.We have built a prototype system implementing this architecture, ETA+AIO (Embedded Transport Acceleration with Asynchronous I/O), and ported a high-performance web-server to the AIO interface. Although the prototype uses modern single-core CPUs instead of future multi-core CPUs, an analysis of its performance can reveal important properties of this approach. Our experiments show that the ETA+AIO prototype has a modest advantage over the baseline Linux system in packet processing efficiency, consuming fewer CPU cycles to sustain the same throughput. This efficiency advantage enables the ETA+AIO prototype to achieve higher peak throughput than the baseline system, but only for workloads where the mix of packet processing and application processing approximately matches the allocation of CPUs in the ETA+AIO system thereby enabling high utilization of all the CPUs. Detailed analysis shows that the efficiency advantage of the ETA+AIO prototype, which uses one PPE CPU, comes from avoiding multiprocessing overheads in packet processing, lower overhead of our AIO interface compared to standard sockets, and reduced cache misses due to processor partitioning.

#!In the first part of this paper we determine the largest step size of Runge-Kutta (RK) methods for which the corresponding numerical approximations are positive (component-wise non-negative) for arbitrary positive initial vector, whenever the underlying initial value problem (IVP) possesses the related positivity preserving property. We prove that step size thresholds for certain classes of positive IVPs guaranteeing positivity that we derived in a former paper are strict for irreducible and non-confluent RK methods. Investigating the strict positivity step size thresholds we can see that these are rather small if at all positive: often they are, roughly speaking, inverse proportional to the Lipschitz constant of the problem.However, for certain (stiff) IVPs with some particular initial vectors, e.g., for some "smooth" vectors in semi-discretized diffusion problems, we experience preservation of positivity with much larger step sizes than the strict positivity step size threshold. To catch this phenomenon, in the second part of the paper we construct positively invariant sets of positive vectors and derive step size thresholds for the discrete version of the positive invariance. The resulting threshold for discrete positive invariance is, roughly speaking, inverse proportional to the one-sided Lipschitz constant only and is shown in good accordance with some displayed computational experiments.

#!Processor emulators are a software tool for allowing legacy computer programs to be executed on a modern processor. In the past emulators have been used in trivial applications such as maintenance of video games. Now, however, processor emulation is being applied to safety-critical control systems, including military avionics. These applications demand utmost guarantees of correctness, but no verification techniques exist for proving that an emulated system preserves the original system&#x2019;s functional and timing properties. Here we show how this can be done by combining concepts previously used for reasoning about real-time program compilation, coupled with an understanding of the new and old software architectures. In particular, we show how both the old and new systems can be given a common semantics, thus allowing their behaviours to be compared directly.

#!Because of its applicability, as well as its generality, research in the area of simulation-optimization continues to attract significant attention. These methods, most of which rely on the statistically motivated search techniques, are at their best when very little is known about the structure of the function (e.g., function evaluations are treated as "blackbox" function-calls). In some applications such as the one discussed in this paper, objective function values may be obtained through linear/network flow optimization models. In such cases, the objective function may be convex, and in such circumstances, very large instances can be solved using stochastic programming techniques. This paper presents a computational case for using such techniques, whenever applicable.

This book covers the latest topics in network attacks and security. It includes a detailed security-minded examination of return on investment (ROI) and associated financial methodologies that yield both objective and subjective data. The book also introduces and explores the concept of return on prevention (ROP) and discusses the greater implications currently facing corporations, including governance and the fundamental importance of security, for senior executives and the board.Making technical issues accessible, this book presents an overview of security technologies that uses a holistic and objective model to quantify issues such as ROI, total cost of ownership (TCO), and risk tolerance. This book explores capital expenditures and fixed and variable costs, such as maintenance and upgrades, to determine a realistic TCO figure, which in turn is used as the foundation in calculating ROI. The importance of security policies addressing such issues as Internet usage, remote-access usage, and incident reporting is also discussed, acknowledging that the most comprehensive security equipment will not protect an organization if it is poorly configured, implemented, or used. Quick reference sheets and worksheets, included in the appendixes, provide technology reviews and allow financial modeling exercises to be performed easily.An essential IT security-investing tool written from a business management perspective, The Business Case for Network Security: Advocacy, Governance, and ROI helps you determine the effective ROP for your business.This volume is in the Network Business Series offered by Cisco Press®.

#!Diversity of classifiers is generally accepted as being necessary for combining them in a committee. Quantifying diversity of classifiers, however, is difficult as there is no formal definition thereof. Numerous measures have been proposed in literature, but their performance is often know to be suboptimal. Here several common methods are compared with a novel approach focusing on the diversity of the errors made by the member classifiers. Experiments with combining classifiers for handwritten character recognition are presented. The results show that the approach of diversity of errors is beneficial, and that the novel exponential error count measure is capable of consistently finding an effective member classifier set.

#!Run-time conflicts can affect even the most rigorously tested software systems. A reliance on execution-based testing makes it prohibitively costly to test every possible interaction among potentially thousands of programs with complex configurations. In order to reduce configuration problems, detect developer errors, and reduce developer effort, we have created a new first class operating system abstraction, the application abstraction, which enables both online and offline reasoning about programs and their configuration requirements.We have implemented a subset of the application abstraction for device drivers in the Singularity operating system. Programmers use the application abstraction by placing declarative statements about hardware and communication requirements within their code. Our design enables Singularity to learn the input/output and interprocess communication requirements of drivers without executing driver code. By reasoning about this information within the domain of Singularity's strong software isolation architecture, the installer can execute a subset the system's resource management algorithm at install time to verify that a new driver will not conflict with existing software. This abstract representation also allows the system to run the full algorithm at driver start time to ensure that there are never resource conflicts between executing drivers, and that drivers never use undeclared resources.

#%108974
#!This paper presents a brief exposition of three underempha-sized issues concerning modeling and simulation as they relate to Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems. One issue concerns the fact that conventional procedures for validation of data-driven models and simulations are unnecessary as they intrinsically contain validation in that they have been constructed according to acquired data. Another issue concerns the inherent coupling between the experimental frame used to measure system response and the system itself. This coupling can lead to an unrealistic simulation of the system in that the data contains the interaction of the system with the experimental frame. The final issue concerns the inherent pluralism of parametric representation and of potential mappings from data space into model space. This inherent pluralism imposes the need for optimal model and data space navigation procedures that are structured for appropriate sampling of data space and specification of faithful model parameterizations.

#!Several types of production systems have been studied and researched in the past using either simulation and\or optimization methods. In this paper we describe the design and development of a simulation assisted predictive-reactive system for scheduling and rescheduling a typical flexible production system configuration. Aspects like the combined use of simulation and optimization to solve complex scheduling and rescheduling tasks are described in view of system stability and some of the broader production system elements like buffer sizing and material handling equipment. Results show that combining simulation and optimization for predictive scheduling resulted in better and valid performance measures for a typical example. Results also show that some newly addressed aspects of stability and real-time control can be handled efficiently using a combination of simulation and optimization. Our discussions only bolster the claim that simulation is an indispensable tool in managing complex production systems.

#!One of the main difficult problem in video analysis is to track moving objects during a video sequence, especially in presence of occlusions. Unfortunately, almost all the different approaches work on a pixel-by-pixel basis, yielding them unusable in real-time situations as well as not much expressive at a semantic level of the video. We present in this paper a novel method of tracking objects through occlusions that exploits the wealth of information due to the spatial coherence between pixels, using a graph-based, multi-resolution representation of the moving regions. The experimental results show that the approach is promising.

#!Unsupervised clustering is an important tool to analyze video data. Selection of an appropriate clustering scheme is governed by the suitability of the clusters it produces. It is difficult to formulate cluster suitability criteria for a domain where different feature attributes have different meanings. We propose a novel clustering strategy, tailored towards the specific requirements of clustering in video data. Our clustering methodology decouples clustering along different feature components. Our scheme chooses the clustering model so as to meet the requirements of clustering in video data. The clusters obtained from our scheme reasonably model the homogeneous color regions in a video scene in both space and time. The space-time clusters obtained by our clustering methodology can be subsequently grouped together to compose meaningful objects. Experimental comparison of our results with existing clustering techniques clearly show that our scheme takes care of many of the problems with traditional clustering schemes applied to the heterogeneous feature space of video.

#!We present a statistical method that uses prediction modeling to decrease the temporally redundant data transmitted back to the sink. The major novelties are fourfold: First, a prediction model is fit to the sensor data. Second, prediction error is utilized to adaptively update the model parameters using hypothesis testing. Third, a data transformation is proposed to bring the sensor sample series closer to weak stationarity. Finally, an efficient implementation is presented. We show that our proposed preDiction eRror bASed hypoThesis testInG (DRASTIG) method achieves low energy dissipation while keeping the prediction errors at user-defined tolerable magnitudes based on real data experiments.

#!Motivation and Methods: All living organisms and the survival of all cells critically depend on their ability to sense and quickly adapt to changes in the environment and to other stress conditions. We study stress response mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by identifying genes that, according to very stringent criteria, have persistent co-expression under a variety of stress conditions. This is enabled through a fast clique search method applied to the intersection of several co-expression graphs calculated over the data of Gasch et al. This method exploits the topological characteristics of these graphs. Results: We observe cliques in the intersection graphs that are much larger than expected under a null model of changing gene identities for different stress conditions but maintaining the co-expression topology within each one. Persistent cliques are analyzed to identify enriched function as well as enriched regulation by a small number of TFs. These TFs, therefore, characterize a universal and persistent reaction to stress response. We further demonstrate that the vertices (genes) of many cliques in the intersection graphs are co-localized in the yeast genome, to a degree far beyond the random expectation. Co-localization can hypothetically contribute to a quick co-ordinated response. We propose the use of persistent cliques in further study of properties of co-regulation.

#!This paper is concerned with supporting the use of ISO 17799: 2005 information security management standard for the purpose of providing a 'common safe environment' for information services. The paper introduces a STOPE view of the standard, integrating its parts and protection measures around the basic domains of 'strategy, technology, organization, people, and environment'. The paper also presents an approach for the application of the standard, considering the STOPE view, in a way that emphasizes continuous improvement. The phases of the approach are based on the phases of six sigma DMAIC approach of 'define, measure, analyze, improve, and control'; the team proposed for the implementation of the work is also based on six sigma principles. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future related and needed work.

#!In this paper, we consider a multi-objective simulation optimization problem with three features: huge solution space, high uncertainty in performance measures, and multi-objective problem which requires a set of nondominated solutions. Our main purpose is to study how to integrate statistical selection with search mechanism to address the above difficulties, and to present a general solution framework for solving such problems. Here due to the multi-objective nature, statistical selection is done by the multi-objective computing budget allocation (MOCBA) procedure. For illustration, MOCBA is integrated with two meta-heuristics: multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) and nested partitions (NP) to identify the nondominated solutions for two inventory management case study problems. Results show that, the integrated solution framework has improved both search efficiency and simulation efficiency. Moreover, it is capable of identifying a set of non-dominated solutions with high confidence.

#!In most interactive systems, the handling of text and images are still quite separate matters. Rendering pipelines handle 2D and 3D graphics, while text tends to be an after-thought which is hardly integrated at the system level, let alone at the level of user interaction.This talk will survey recent developments in the area of image-text interaction from both the system architecture point of view and with respect to user interfaces. The talk will emphasize interactive labelling of 2D and 3D graphics and outline new real-time algorithms for label placement. Labelled images will be discussed as an interface to methods and tools for data mining. Finally, challenges for future developments in the area of image-text interaction will be outlined.

#!Supercritical fluids represent an active field of research, interesting from the theoretical point of view, and for industrial applications. We describe a numerical method for the simulation of supercritical fluid flow phenomena, valid for a general real gas equation of state. Three state equations (van der Waals, Carnahan-Starling-De Santis, Redlich-Kwong), describing the thermodynamic behavior of a gas near its critical point are implemented. Numerical tests in the case of the flow through a nozzle and the shock tube problem, show the reliability of the numerical scheme. The response of a supercritical fluid confined into a slab with closed ends, initially at rest in thermodynamic equilibrium, when one boundary is heated, termed Piston effect, is also investigated.

#!Microsoft Office is the number-one selling software for the Mac; the Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage applications are more dominant in the Mac world than they are among PC users. And Microsoft has greatly improved and enhanced Office 2004 to take advantage of the latest Mac OX features. In short, Microsoft Office for the Mac is wildly popular and better than ever. But as incredible and powerful it is, the Office 2004 suite comes without a single page of printed instructions. That means you're left to forge your own path through its countless innovative and useful new features and tools--until now. Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual is the manual that should have been in the box. It's the map that clearly and easily guides both beginners and veterans through this new suite. Mark H. Walker, Franklin Tessler, and Paul Berkowitz deliver all the practical information you need to master the basics and make the most of all four Office 2004 programs--Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage. It's four books in one! According to Microsoft's own research, the average Office user taps into less than fifteen percent of the suite's features. With first-rate writing, a handcrafted index, and the trademark humor and clarity of every Missing Manual, Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual will change that. Because this isn't an authorized book, Walker, Tessler, and Berkowitz candidly point out which features are gems in the rough worthy of your focused attention--and which are junkware that you best continue to overlook. Whether you're an Office beginner eager to master one or all of the applications in the suite or a longtime Office user looking for detailed coverage of what's new (and what's removed) in Office 2004 and hoping to implement power-user techniques for better and more efficient work, this funny and friendly, comprehensive guide will prove indispensable.

#!In a manufacturing system, we need to capture collaborative processes among its components in order to clearly define supporting functions of a system. However, pervasive process modeling techniques, including IDEF3, Petri Nets, and UML, are not sufficient for modeling collaborative processes. Therefore, we have developed a novel modeling method referred to as collaborative process modeling (CPM) to describe collaborative processes. CPM models can be transformed into marked graph models so that we can use the analysis power of Petri Nets. In this paper, we first briefly discuss these process modeling techniques. Then, we illustrate the CPM method and transformation rules with illustrative examples. CPM allows us to develop collaborative process models, understand and facilitate the realization of collaboration, and verify models before moving onto development.

The splines approximate the option's value function at each time step, and the value function approximations are then used to construct a martingale that serves as the control variate. Significant variance reduction is possible even in high dimensions. The primary restriction is that we must be able to compute certain one-step conditional expectations.

#!In this IBM Redbook we describe and demonstrate dimensional data modeling techniques and technology, specifically focused on business intelligence and data warehousing. It is to help the reader understand how to design, maintain, and use a dimensional model for data warehousing that can provide the data access and performance required for business intelligence. Business intelligence is comprised of a data warehousing infrastructure, and a query, analysis, and reporting environment. Here we focus on the data warehousing infrastructure. But only a specific element of it, the data model - which we consider the base building block of the data warehouse. Or, more precisely, the topic of data modeling and its impact on the business and business applications. The objective is not to provide a treatise on dimensional modeling techniques, but to focus at a more practical level. There is technical content for designing and maintaining such an environment, but also business content. For example, we use case studies to demonstrate how dimensional modeling can impact the business intelligence requirements for your business initiatives. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion on the query aspects of BI and data modeling. For example, we discuss query optimization and how you can determine performance of the data model prior to implementation. You need a solid base for your data warehousing infrastructure . . . . a solid data model.

#!The dual simplex algorithm has become a strong contender in solving large scale LP problems. One key problem of any dual simplex algorithm is to obtain a dual feasible basis as a starting point. We give an overview of methods which have been proposed in the literature and present new stable and efficient ways to combine them within a state-of-the-art optimization system for solving real world linear and mixed integer programs. Furthermore, we address implementation aspects and the connection between dual feasibility and LP-preprocessing. Computational results are given for a large set of large scale LP problems, which show our dual simplex implementation to be superior to the best existing research and open-source codes and competitive to the leading commercial code on many of our most difficult problem instances.

#!Data sharing among organizations, both government and business, has increased with the advent of the Internet. The study is motivated by the need to address increased confidentiality and privacy concerns that arise with the use of the Internet, while realizing the benefits of data sharing. In this study, we develop a research issues framework based on a survey of existing literature. The framework is used to identify OR/MS research opportunities in disclosure prevention, record-linkage, and in the assessment of the impact of data sharing. Addressing these issues could enable organizations to securely share data.

#!Image classification arises as an important phase in the overall process of automatic image annotation and image retrieval. In this study, we are concerned with the design of image classifiers developed in the feature space formed by low level primitives defined in the setting of the MPEG-7 standard. Our objective is to investigate the discriminatory properties of such standard image descriptors and look at efficient architectures of the classifiers along with their design pursuits. The generalization capabilities of an image classifier are essential to its successful usage in image retrieval and annotation. Intuitively, it is expected that the classifier should achieve high classification accuracy on unseen images that are quite ''similar'' to those occurring in the training set. On the other hand, we may assume that the performance of the classifier could not be guaranteed in the case of images that are very much dissimilar from the elements of the training set. To follow this observation, we develop and use a concept of the localized generalization error and show how it guides the design of the classifier. As image classifier, we consider the usage of the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). Through intensive experimentation we show that the resulting classifier outperforms other classifiers such as a multi-class support vector machines (SVMs) as well as ''standard'' RBFNNs (viz. those developed without the guidance offered by the optimization of the localized generalization error). The experimental studies reveal some interesting interpretation abilities of the RBFNN classifiers being related with their receptive fields.

#!Recent developments in crowd simulation have allowed thousands of characters to be rendered in real-time. Usually this is achieved through the use of Level of Detail (LOD) models for the individuals in the crowd. Perceptual studies have shown that image-based representations, i.e., impostors, can be used as imperceptible background substitutes for high-polygon models for skinned human characters, resulting in optimal rendering times and high visual fidelity. However, previous methods only showed humans dressed in clothes that were deformed using standard skinning methods. Highly deformable objects like cloth are not effectively depicted using these methods. Therefore, in this paper, we present the first perceptual evaluation of different LOD representations of humans wearing deformable (i.e., physically simulated) clothing. We show conclusively that impostors are startlingly effective at depicting the deformation properties of clothing and present useful guidelines for the development of crowd systems with thousands of realistically clothed humans.

Our referent systems are in vitro cell cultures commonly used for studies of morphogenetic processes that underlie the development of the embryo and its organ systems. We have constructed discrete event, agent-based models with agent rules that capture posited processes of cell proliferation and death involved in the formation of multicellular epithelial structures such as cysts and tubules. We report on their application in exploring the phenotypic consequences of disabling the simulated processes, and show that varying degrees of the disablement cause different growth patterns to emerge, including a cancer-like phenotype.

#!The Internet is a fast growing mechanism for providing workplace monitoring. We examined how its implementation affects employees' trust in the organization. We hypothesized that giving employees advance notice of monitoring and providing them a justification for it would enhance their trust. We investigated how employees' perceptions of organizational support prior to monitoring moderated these relationships by conducting a longitudinal field experiment. We found that advance notice and perceived organizational support exerted significant main and interactive effects on post-implementation trust. In turn, trust significantly affected employees' job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions.

#index6267
#!While some decision-making processes often result in the generation of an observable action, for example eye or limb movements, others may prevent actions and occur without an overt behavioral response. To understand how these decisions are made, one must look directly at their neuronal substrates. We trained two monkeys on a go/no-go task which requires a saccade to a peripheral cue stimulus (go) or maintenance of fixatior (no-go). We performed binary regressions on the activity of single neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), with the go/no-go decision as a predictor variable, and constructed a virtual decision function (VDF) designed to provide a good estimation of decision content and its timing in a single trial decision process. Post hoc analyses by VDF correctly predicted the monkey's choice in more than 80% of trials. These results suggest that monitoring of SC activity has sufficient capacity to predict go/no-go decisions on a trial-by-trial basis.

#!Traditionally, software pipelining is applied either to the innermost loop of a given loop nest or from the innermost loop to outer loops. This paper proposes a three-step approach, called single-dimension software pipelining (SSP), to software pipeline a loop nest at an arbitrary loop level that has a rectangular iteration space and contains no sibling inner loops in it. The first step identifies the most profitable loop level for software pipelining in terms of initiation rate, data reuse potential, or any other optimization criteria. The second step simplifies the multidimensional data-dependence graph (DDG) of the selected loop level into a one-dimensional DDG and constructs a one-dimensional (1D) schedule. Based on the one-dimensional schedule, the third step derives a simple mapping function that specifies the schedule time for the operation instances in the multidimensional loop. The classical modulo scheduling is subsumed by SSP as a special case. SSP is also closely related to hyperplane scheduling, and, in fact, extends it to be resource constrained. We prove that SSP schedules are correct and at least as efficient as those schedules generated by traditional modulo scheduling methods. We extend SSP to schedule imperfect loop nests, which are most common at the instruction level. Multiple initiation intervals are naturally allowed to improve execution efficiency. Feasibility and correctness of our approach are verified by a prototype implementation in the ORC compiler for the IA-64 architecture, tested with loop nests from Livermore and SPEC2000 floating-point benchmarks. Preliminary experimental results reveal that, compared to modulo scheduling, software pipelining at an appropriate loop level results in significant performance improvement. Software pipelining is beneficial even with prior loop transformations.

#!Localized Quality of Service (QoS) routing has recently been proposed as a viable alternative approach to traditional QoS routing algorithms that use global state information. In this approach, problems associated with maintaining global state information and the staleness of such information are avoided by having the source nodes to infer the network QoS state based on flow blocking statistics collected locally, and perform flow routing using this localized view of the network QoS state . In this paper we introduce a credit based routing algorithm (cbr) which is a simple yet effective localized QoS routing algorithm. We compare its performance against the localized proportional sticky routing (psr) algorithm same time complexity. using different types of network topologies, QoS requirements and traffic patterns and under a wide range of traffic loads. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm outperforms the psr algorithm with the

In this paper, the colorization problem is formulated as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of a color image given a monochrome image. Markov random field (MRF) is used for modeling a color image which is utilized as a prior for the MAP estimation. The MAP estimation problem for a whole image is decomposed into local MAP estimation problems for each pixel. Using 0.6% of whole pixels as references, the proposed method produced pretty high quality color images with 25.7-32.6dB PSNR values for eight images.

Our quadrature is also applicable in the case of adaptive spatial resolution. Our theoretical error estimates are confirmed by numerical test calculations of the ground state energy and wavefunction of the harmonic oscillator in one dimension with and without adaptive resolution. As a byproduct we derive a filter, which, upon application on the scaling function coefficients of a smooth function, renders the approximate grid values of this function. This also allows for a fast calculation of the charge density from the wavefunction.

#!Although independent consideration of layers simplifies wireless system design, it is inadequate since: 1) it does not consider the effect of co-channel user interference on higher layers; 2) it does not address the impact of local adaptation actions on overall performance; and 3) it attempts to optimize performance at one layer while keeping parameters of other layers fixed. Cross-layer adaptation techniques spanning several layers improve performance and provide better quality of service for users across layers. In this study, we consider a synergy between the physical and access layers and address the joint problem of channel allocation, modulation level, and power control in a multicell network. Since performance is determined by channel reuse, it is important to handle co-channel interference appropriately by constructing co-channel user sets and by assigning transmission parameters so that achievable system rate is maximized. The problem is considered for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, which introduces novel challenges to resource allocation due to different quality of subcarriers for users and existing transmit power constraints. We study the structure of the problem and present two classes of centralized heuristic algorithms. The first one considers each subcarrier separately and sequentially allocates users from different base stations in the subcarrier based on different criteria, while the second is based on water-filling across subcarriers in each cell. Our results show that the first class of heuristics performs better and quantify the impact of different parameters on system performance.

#!This paper explores the use of social annotations to improve websearch. Nowadays, many services, e.g. del.icio.us, have been developed for web users to organize and share their favorite webpages on line by using social annotations. We observe that the social annotations can benefit web search in two aspects: 1) the annotations are usually good summaries of corresponding webpages; 2) the count of annotations indicates the popularity of webpages. Two novel algorithms are proposed to incorporate the above information into page ranking: 1) SocialSimRank (SSR)calculates the similarity between social annotations and webqueries; 2) SocialPageRank (SPR) captures the popularity of webpages. Preliminary experimental results show that SSR can find the latent semantic association between queries and annotations, while SPR successfully measures the quality (popularity) of a webpage from the web users' perspective. We further evaluate the proposed methods empirically with 50 manually constructed queries and 3000 auto-generated queries on a dataset crawledfrom delicious. Experiments show that both SSR and SPRbenefit web search significantly.

#!Lifelike animation of object manipulation requires dynamic interaction between animated characters, objects, and their environment. These interactions can be animated automatically with physically based simulations but proper controls are needed to animate characters that move realistically and that accomplish tasks in spite of unexpected disturbances. This paper describes an efficient control algorithm that generates realistic animations by incorporating motion data into task execution. The end result is a versatile system for interactive animation of dynamic manipulation tasks such as lifting, catching, and throwing.

#!Internet portals have long been using email services to attract new members and retain existing customers. Recent announcements by major Internet portals of increases in email storage capacity demonstrate this strategy. It is, however, uncertain how people react to such announcements. We wished to understand the mechanisms associated with users' intention to switch their current email service provider. Key variables pertaining to customer satisfaction with email service, attractive alternatives, and switching cost were examined to explain the dynamics of switching. An empirical study based on 1408 survey responses confirmed the importance of user satisfaction for service continuation. The variables attractive alternatives and continuity cost also demonstrated strong association with intention to switch. We found that the variable attractive alternatives moderated the relationship between customer satisfaction and intention to switch, but a moderating effect of switching cost was not found. Our investigation indicated that the findings of extant studies on the dynamics of service switching or re-purchase also apply to email services.

#!In this paper we propose the combined use of different methods to improve the data analysis process. This is obtained by combining inductive and deductive techniques. We also use different inductive techniques such as clustering algorithms, to derive data partition, and decision trees induction, characterizing classes in terms of logical rules. Inductive techniques are used for generating hypotheses from data whereas deductive techniques are used to derive knowledge and to verify hypotheses. In order to guide users in the analysis process, we have developed a system which integrates deductive tools and data mining tools such as classification algorithms, features selection algorithms, visualization tools and tools to manipulate data sets easily. The system developed is currently used in a large project whose aim is the integration of information sources containing data concerning the socio&dash;economic aspects of Calabria and its subsequent analysis. Several experiments on the socio&dash;economic data have shown that the combined use of different techniques improves both the comprehensibility and the accuracy of models.

#!Complex constraints generally define the performance of air transportation systems. These constraints include aircraft operational characteristics, airline operating procedures, and Air Traffic Control (ATC) requirements. The operational variability that is present in complex air transportation systems and their components typically demands a Monte Carlo approach when modeling system performance metrics. However, the inherent variability is generally not known a priori. This calls for a separate model validation approach that yields estimates of system variability and validates baseline model performance. This paper reports on an integrated aviation modeling platform that was developed for comparing and evaluating proposed aircraft flight operations and ATC procedures. It integrates both an agent-based Monte Carlo modeling environment and a data-driven model validation capability. The capabilities are outlined, the validation approach is described, and examples are presented of performance metrics quantifying operational benefits of air navigation procedures that are currently being implemented at major U.S. airports.

#!We present a translation from Fickle, a small object-oriented language allowing objects to change their class at runtime, into Java. The translation is provenly correct in the sense that it preserves the static and dynamic semantics. Moreover, it is compatible with separate compilation, since the translation of a Fickle class does not depend on the implementation of used classes. Based on the formal system, we have developed an implementation. The translation turned out to be a more subtle problem than we expected. In this article, we discuss four possible approaches we considered for the design of the translation and to justify our choice, we present formally the translation and proof of preservation of the static and dynamic semantics, and discuss the prototype implementation. Moreover, we outline an alternative translation based on generics that avoids most of the casts (but not all) needed in the previous translation. The language Fickle has undergone and is still undergoing several phases of development. In this article we are discussing the translation of FickleII.

#@Yosuke Kimura,Kenichi Ida

#index6383
#!Floorplan design is an important engineering problem. This problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem, in which a given set of rectangles in floorplan must be arranged. The goal is to find the arrangement with minimum area and minimum interconnection. Floorplans can be classified into slicing structure and non-slicing structure problems. In both problem types, it is difficult to obtain a true optimal solution in a time that could be used in practice. We proposed the new immune algorithm for optimization of the slicing structure problem in the past. In this paper, we focus on and analyze the improved points considered to be especially effective, and propose a new genetic algorithm for the non-slicing structure problem. The proposed method is compared with existing methods using well-known benchmark problems.

These different tools are validated on various examples, and their performances are compared. The most powerful, robust and accurate method consists in computing the curvature tensor of the auto-correlation function of regularized images using fast Fourier transforms.

#@Jeff Webb,Steve Saunders

#index6403
#!Why program Excel? For solving complex calculations and presenting results, Excel is amazingly complete with every imaginable feature already in place. But programming Excel isn't about adding new features as much as it's about combining existing features to solve particular problems. With a few modifications, you can transform Excel into a task-specific piece of software that will quickly and precisely serve your needs. In other words, Excel is an ideal platform for probably millions of small spreadsheet-based software solutions. The best part is, you can program Excel with no additional tools. A variant of the Visual Basic programming language, VB for Applications (VBA) is built into Excel to facilitate its use as a platform. With VBA, you can create macros and templates, manipulate user interface features such as menus and toolbars, and work with custom user forms or dialog boxes. VBA is relatively easy to use, but if you've never programmed before, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET is a great way to learn a lot very quickly. If you're an experienced Excel user or a Visual Basic programmer, you'll pick up a lot of valuable new tricks. Developers looking forward to .NET development will also find discussion of how the Excel object model works with .NET tools, including Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO). This book teaches you how to use Excel VBA by explaining concepts clearly and concisely in plain English, and provides plenty of downloadable samples so you can learn by doing. You'll be exposed to a wide range of tasks most commonly performed with Excel, arranged into chapters according to subject, with those subjects corresponding to one or more Excel objects. With both the samples and important reference information for each object included right in the chapters, instead of tucked away in separate sections, Programming Excel with VBA and .NET covers the entire Excel object library. For those just starting out, it also lays down the basic rules common to all programming languages. With this single-source reference and how-to guide, you'll learn to use the complete range of Excel programming tasks to solve problems, no matter what you're experience level.

#!We give polynomial-time quantum algorithms for three problems from computational algebraic number theory. The first is Pell's equation. Given a positive nonsquare integer d, Pell's equation is x2 &minus; dy2 &equals; 1 and the goal is to find its integer solutions. Factoring integers reduces to finding integer solutions of Pell's equation, but a reduction in the other direction is not known and appears more difficult. The second problem we solve is the principal ideal problem in real quadratic number fields. This problem, which is at least as hard as solving Pell's equation, is the one-way function underlying the Buchmann--Williams key exchange system, which is therefore broken by our quantum algorithm. Finally, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, this algorithm can be used to compute the class group of a real quadratic number field.

#!We present a parallel explicit/implicit time integration scheme well suited for block-adaptive grids. The basic idea of the algorithm is that the time stepping scheme can differ in the blocks of the grid for a given time step: an explicit scheme is used in the blocks where the local stability requirement is not violated and an implicit scheme is used in the blocks where the explicit scheme would be unstable. The implicit scheme is second order in time. The non-linear system of equations is linearized with Newton linearization. The linear system is solved with a preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative scheme. The Schwarz type preconditioning is also based on the block structure of the grid. We discuss load balancing for parallel execution and the optimal choice of the time step for speed and robustness. The parallel efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated for the equations of magnetohydrodynamics with a geophysics application in three dimensions. The control of the numerical divergence of the magnetic field in combination with the explicit/implicit time stepping scheme is also discussed.

#@Yunhui He,Li Zhao,Cairong Zou
#t2006
#cPattern Recognition
#index6442
#%95021
#!In this paper, we propose a face recognition method called the commonface by using the common vector approach. A face image is regarded as a summation of a common vector which represents the invariant properties of the corresponding face class, and a difference vector which presents the specific properties of the corresponding face image such as face appearance, pose and expression. Thus, by deriving the common vector of each face class, the common feature of each person is obtained which removes the differences of face images belonging to the same person. For test face image, the remaining vector with each face class is derived with the similar procedure to the common vector, which is then compared with the common vector of each face class to predict the class label of query face by finding the minimum distance between the remaining vector and the common vector. Furthermore, we extend the common vector approach (CVP) to kernel CVP to improve the performance of CVP. The experimental results suggest that the proposed commonface approach provides a better representation of individual common feature and achieves lower error rates in face recognition.

#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index6443
#%24316
#!The Joint Integrated Mission Model (JIMM) is a legacy real-time discrete-event simulator. Its initial single threaded implementation employed a memory pool to speed up run-time performance and easily checkpoint simulation state. Unfortunately, when JIMM started migrating to a multi-threaded implementation, this legacy memory pool was quickly identified as a bottleneck. This problem is addressed by dividing the memory into large chunks managed by a global controller but where threadspecific memory managers handled lower level memory allocation. This paper will focus on the legacy memory pool in JIMM and enhancements necessary for an efficient multi-threaded implementation.

Such property guarantees that each directional link has the same uploading bandwidth. Together with the Tit-for-Tat policy, peers upload and download at the same rate over each connection and therefore achieve fairness.

#!We analyze the conditions under which a memory system is prone to interference between new and old items. Essentially, these are the distributedness of the representation and the lack of retraining. Both are, however, desirable features providing compactness and speed. Thus, a two&dash;stage framework to palliate interference in this type of systems is proposed based on exploiting the information available at each moment. The two stages are separated by the instant at which a new item becomes known: (a) interference prevention, prior to that instant, consists in preparing the system to minimize the impact of learning new items and (b) retroactive interference minimization, posterior to that instant, seeks to learn the new item while minimizing the damages inflicted on the old items. The subproblems addressed at the two stages are stated rigorously and possible methods to solve each of them are presented.

#!Although inexact graph-matching is a problem of potentially exponential complexity, the problem may be simplified by decomposing the graphs to be matched into smaller subgraphs. If this is done, then the process may cast into a hierarchical framework and hence rendered suitable for parallel computation. In this paper we describe a spectral method which can be used to partition graphs into non-overlapping subgraphs. In particular, we demonstrate how the Fiedler-vector of the Laplacian matrix can be used to decompose graphs into non-overlapping neighbourhoods that can be used for the purposes of both matching and clustering.

#*Efficient inference on known phylogenetic trees using Poisson regression
#@Saharon Rosset
#t2007
#cBioinformatics
#index6461
#!Motivation: We suggest the use of Poisson regression for time inference and hypothesis testing on a bifurcating Phylogenetic tree with known topology. This method is computationally simple and naturally accommodates variable substitution rates across different sites, without requiring the estimation of these rates. We identify the assumptions under which this is a maximum-likelihood inference approach and show that in some realistic situations---in particular, when the probability of repeated mutation within each branch of the tree is small---these assumptions hold with high probability. Results: Our motivating domain is human mitochondrial DNA trees, and we illustrate our method on a problem of estimating the time to most recent common ancestor of all non-African mtDNA, using publicly available data. We test for molecular clock violations using multiple comparisons, and conclude that the global molecular clock hypothesis cannot be rejected based on these data. Contact: srosset@us.ibm.com

#!With the availability of huge databases cataloguing the various molecular "parts of complex biological systems, researchers from multiple disciplines have focused on developing modeling and simulation tools for studying the variability of cellular behavior at a system level - encompassing the dynamics arising from many species of interacting molecules. In this work, we present a system engineering approach to model biological processes. In this approach, a biological process is modeled as a collection of interacting functions driven in time by a set of discrete events. We focus on the discrete event simulation platform, called "iSimBioSys, which we have developed for studying the dynamics of cellular processes in silico. As a testbed for studying our approach we model the two component PhoPQ system, responsible for the expression of several virulence genes in Salmonella Typhimurium. We analyzed the effect of extra cellular magnesium on the behavioral dynamics of this pathway using our framework and compared the results with an experimental system. We also analyze the performance of iSimBioSys, based on the model biological system, in terms of system usage and response.

#!A new method for improving the timing yield of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices affected by random within-die variation is proposed. By selection of an appropriate configuration from a set of functionally equivalent configurations such that the critical paths do not share same circuit resources on the FPGA, both the average critical path delay and its standard deviation are reduced substantially under conditions of large random variation. Large within-die variations of device parameters such as transistor threshold voltage are anticipated in future semiconductor technologies, resulting in degradation of parametric yields. Comparing to the previous approach which compensates for such within-die variation by designing circuit placement for each chip using variation information measured before, our method does not require the measurement of process variations and execution of design tools for each chip. The average critical path delay is reduced by up to 5% assuming 30% (σ/μ) variation in threshold voltage, with a corresponding 50% decrease in standard deviation.

#!In this paper, we present insights generated by modeling the emergence of insider threat vulnerabilities in organizations. In our model, we integrate concepts from social judgment theory, signal detection theory, and the cognitive psychology of memory and belief formation. With this model, we investigate the emergence of vulnerabilities (especially that are insider-driven) in complex systems characterized by high levels of feedback complexity, multiple actors, and the presence of uncertainty in the judgment and decision processes. We use the system dynamics method of computer simulation to investigate the consequences caused by changes to the model's assumptions. We find that the emergence of vulnerability can be an endogenous process and that leverage points to reduce this vulnerability involve improvement in information acquisition, information management, and the training of personnel in judgment and decision-making techniques

#!Real-Time System (RTS) correctness and timeliness are critical. Modeling and Simulation techniques have been widely used for testing particular conditions on these systems. Recently, the DEVS formalism has been successfully used as a framework for RTS validation. Nevertheless, we need to address dynamic adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment. Dynamic Structure DEVS focuses on the possibility to change system structure dynamically according to the system real requirements, which is useful for RTS (in which sometimes it is impossible to interfere with the running of the system, and auto-adaptation is needed). We present a new algorithm derived from the DSDE and the dynDEVS formalisms. We use the DSDE formal specifications, and parts of the dynDEVS simulation algorithms.

#!In this article, we describe a genetic algorithm for optimizing the superpeer structure of semantic peer to peer networks. Peer to peer, also called P2P, networks enable us to search for content or information in a distributed fashion across a large number of peers while providing a level of fault tolerance by preventing disconnecting peers from disrupting the network. We seek to maximize the number of queries answered while minimizing the time in which they are answered. It will be shown that the genetic algorithm (GA) dramatically improves network performance and consistently finds networks better than those found by random search and hill climbing. A comparison will also be made to networks found through exhaustive search, showing that the GA will, for smaller networks, converge on a globally optimal solution.

#!A Society of Simulations (SoS) approach defines a semantics-based standard for integrating heterogeneous simulations. Heterogeneity, independent development, and cross-domain modeling are characteristics of behavior-based simulations that are built to address complex, non-functional situations. SoS is a dynamic data driven approach wherein emergent behaviors result from specialized simulations grouped together as individual members in a society. Each member simulation independently operates on its own understanding of reality. Members cooperate with each other to achieve the goals of the society while satisfying their own local goals. When members interact, portions of their models of reality coincide. Such interaction and coordination among diverse autonomous simulations is enabled through the implementation of a shared reality. Comprehensive, life-like situations can be modeled by applying the concept of a SoS.

#*Inclusive development: Software engineering requirements for universally accessible interactions

#index6522
#!The notion of 'universal access' reflects the concept of an Information Society in which potentially anyone (i.e. any user) will interact with computing machines, at anytime and anyplace (i.e. in any context of use) and for virtually anything (i.e. for any task). Towards reaching a successful and cost effective realization of this vision, it is critical to ensure that the future interface development tools provide all the necessary instrumentation to support inclusive design, i.e. facilitate inclusive development. In the meantime, it is crucial that both tool developers and interface developers acquire awareness regarding the key development features they should pursue when investigating for the most appropriate software engineering support in addressing such a largely demanding development goal (i.e. universally accessible interactions). This paper discusses a corpus of key development requirements for building universally accessible interactions that has been consolidated from real practice, in the course of six medium-to-large scale research projects, all completed, within a 10 years timeframe.

#!This paper investigates subset antenna transmission (SAT) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in the presence of strong dominant co-channel interferer. The capacity gain from SAT is investigated in the context of optimal antenna subset selection and power allocation. The SAT does not require channel state information of the co-channel interference, and achieves capacity gains by distributing the transmit power equally over a selected subset of the transmit antennas. The capacity gain of the SAT method is analyzed in terms of transmit power and eigenvalues of channel matrix, and its performance in V-BLAST MIMO systems with various signal constellations is evaluated by computer simulation.

#!We explore a new approach to defense of computer systems, deliberately deceiving attackers as to resource availability. This can be more effective than outright denial of access because it encourages an attacker to waste time continuing their attack. But effective deceptions must be consistent to convince an adversary. We are exploring automated methods for maintaining logical consistency by tracking assertions made so far with associated causal and other indirect implications. We have built a deception planner that takes as input as sequence of operating-system commands and finds the possible consistent deceptions as per our logical constraints, and rates the deceptions using several criteria. In a test on a generic planning model of rootkit installation, it found 72 of 558 possible deceptions were acceptable and rated them.

#!In an autonomic computing system, an autonomic manager makes tuning, load balancing, or provisioning decisions based on a predictive model of the system. This article investigates performance analysis techniques used by the autonomic manager. It looks at the complexity of the workloads and presents algorithms for computing the bounds of performance metrics for distributed systems under asymptotic and nonasymptotic conditions, that is, with saturated and nonsaturated resources. The techniques used are hybrid in nature, making use of performance evaluation and linear and nonlinear programming models. The workloads are characterized by the workload intensity, which represents the total number of users in the system, and by the workload mixes, which depict the number of users in each class of service. The results presented in this article can be applied to distributed transactional systems. Such systems serve a large number of users with many classes of services and can thus be considered as representative of a large class of autonomic computing systems.

#!We describe LEAP&plus; (Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol), a key management protocol for sensor networks that is designed to support in-network processing, while at the same time restricting the security impact of a node compromise to the immediate network neighborhood of the compromised node. The design of the protocol is motivated by the observation that different types of messages exchanged between sensor nodes have different security requirements, and that a single keying mechanism is not suitable for meeting these different security requirements. LEAP&plus; supports the establishment of four types of keys for each sensor node: an individual key shared with the base station, a pairwise key shared with another sensor node, a cluster key shared with multiple neighboring nodes, and a global key shared by all the nodes in the network. LEAP&plus; also supports (weak) local source authentication without precluding in-network processing. Our performance analysis shows that LEAP&plus; is very efficient in terms of computational, communication, and storage costs. We analyze the security of LEAP&plus; under various attack models and show that LEAP&plus; is very effective in defending against many sophisticated attacks, such as HELLO flood attacks, node cloning attacks, and wormhole attacks. A prototype implementation of LEAP&plus; on a sensor network testbed is also described.

#!Capacity constrained make-to-order manufacturing systems with exogenously set due dates and heavy tardiness penalties can be effectively managed by selective acceptance of orders, especially when the system encounters heavy congestion. This is demonstrated using a popular order acceptance rule. How this rule can optimally control a manufacturing system under different environments and how the main performance measures of the manufacturing system are affected in doing so, are demonstrated and analyzed. The study is done on a simulated hypothetical manufacturing system used as a testbed.

We do not use single-threaded objects or ACL2 arrays, which frees the user from syntactic restrictions and slow-array warnings.

#!Fuzzy logic is based on sets of rules that can be easily understood by the students, since they bear a close resemblance to natural language. The introduction of fuzzy logic, within the framework of Environmental Education, is considered to be necessary in order to provide an insight to the complex environmental interactions. Fuzzy inference is introduced in this paper as an extension of hypothetico-predictive argumentation and it allows the investigation of alternative hypotheses. This is achieved through the development of an interactive computer graphics environment that encompasses a set of fuzzy logic analysis tools and a fuzzy inference model of a lake. The fuzzy model guarantees the scientific integrity of the simulation results, and the graphical interface presents to the students only the comprehensible characteristics of the environmental stressors in the ecosystem of the lake. The proposed graphical interface was developed in successive design stages, with the active participation of the students. The results of the students' experimentation with the graphical interface indicate that their comprehension of the significant environmental problems of the lake is considerably improved and some misconceptions are resolved. Thus, it is considered valuable as an aid to environmental education.

#!Achieving effective coordination among suppliers and retailers has become a pertinent research issue in supply chain management. Channel coordination is a joint decision policy achieved by a supplier(s) and a retailer(s) characterized by an agreement on the order quantity and the trade credit scenario (e.g., quantity discounts, delay in payments). This paper proposes a centralized model where players in a two-level (supplier-retailer) supply chain coordinate their orders to minimize their local costs and that of the chain. In the proposed supply chain model the permissible delay in payments is considered as a decision variable and it is adopted as a trade credit scenario to coordinate the order quantity between the two-levels. Computational results indicate that with coordination, the retailer orders in larger quantities than its economic order quantity, with savings to either both players, or to one in the supply chain. Moreover, a profit-sharing scenario for the distribution of generated net savings among the players in the supply chain is presented. Analytical and experimental results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

#!The development of natural multimodal dialogue systems remains a very difficult task. The flexibility and naturalness they offer result in an increased complexity that current software tools do not address appropriately. One challenging issue we address here is the generation of cooperative responses in an appropriate multimodal form, highlighting the intertwined relation of content and presentation. We identify a key component, the dialogic strategy component, as a mediator between the natural dialogue management and the multimodal presentation. This component selects the semantic information content to be presented according to various presentation constraints. Constraints include inherent characteristics of modalities, the availability of a modality as well as preferences of the user. Thus the cooperative behaviour of the system could be adapted as could its multimodal behaviour. In this paper, we present the dialogic strategy component and an associated platform to quickly develop output multimodal cooperative responses in order to explore different dialogic strategies.

#!Traditionally, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is cardinal in nature. Ordinal optimization was only introduced recently. Since ordinal optimization has been proven to be successful in certain applications, this paper aims to investigate whether ordinal optimization improves RSM by developing ordinal RSM and comparing it with cardinal RSM in terms of efficiency, accuracy and consistency. Assuming that the performances of systems can be expressed as functions of their parameters, both ordinal and cardinal RSM are simulated for several simple multivariable mathematical functions and the effectiveness of ordinal RSM evaluated. It was found that ordinal does not always improve RSM, especially in functions which exhibit a large gradient change over a small region.

#*Modeling protein dependency networks using CoCoA

#index6559
#%510081
#!In an interdisciplinary effort to model protein dependency networks, biologists measure signals from certain proteins within cells over a given interval of time. Using this time series data, the goal is to deduce protein dependency relationships. The mathematical challenges is to statistically measure correlations between given proteins over time in order to conjecture probable relationships. Biologists can then consider these relationships with more scrutiny, in order to confirm their conjectures. One algorithm for finding such relationships makes use of interpolation of the data to produce next-state functions for each protein and the Deegan-Packel Index of Power voting method to measure the strength of correlations between pairs of proteins. The algorithm was previously implemented, but limitations associated with the original language required the algorithm to be re-implemented in a more computationally efficient language. Because of the algebraic focus of the Computational Commutative Algebra language, or CoCoA, the algorithm was re-implemented in this language, and results have been produced much more efficiently. In this paper I discuss the algorithm, the CoCoA language, the implementation of the algorithm in CoCoA, and the quality of the results.

#*Identifying HLA supertypes by learning distance functions
#@Tomer Hertz,Chen Yanover
#t2007
#cBioinformatics
#index6570
#!Motivation: The development of epitope-based vaccines crucially relies on the ability to classify Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules into sets that have similar peptide binding specificities, termed supertypes. In their seminal work, Sette and Sidney defined nine HLA class I supertypes and claimed that these provide an almost perfect coverage of the entire repertoire of HLA class I molecules. HLA alleles are highly polymorphic and polygenic and therefore experimentally classifying each of these molecules to supertypes is at present an impossible task. Recently, a number of computational methods have been proposed for this task. These methods are based on defining protein similarity measures, derived from analysis of binding peptides or from analysis of the proteins themselves. Results: In this paper we define both peptide derived and protein derived similarity measures, which are based on learning distance functions. The peptide derived measure is defined using a peptide--peptide distance function, which is learned using information about known binding and non-binding peptides. The protein derived similarity measure is defined using a protein--protein distance function, which is learned using information about alleles previously classified to supertypes by Sette and Sidney (1999). We compare the classification obtained by these two complimentary methods to previously suggested classification methods. In general, our results are in excellent agreement with the classifications suggested by Sette and Sidney (1999) and with those reported by Buus et al. (2004). The main important advantage of our proposed distance-based approach is that it makes use of two different and important immunological sources of information---HLA alleles and peptides that are known to bind or not bind to these alleles. Since each of our distance measures is trained using a different source of information, their combination can provide a more confident classification of alleles to supertypes.

#!Microsoft Excel continues to grow in power, sophistication, and capability, but one thing that has changed very little since the early '90s is its user interface. The once-simple toolbar has been packed with so many features over the years that few users know where to find them all. Microsoft has addressed this problem in Excel 2007 by radically redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes every feature easy to locate and use. Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as scant as ever, so even if users can find advanced features, they probably won't know what to do with them. Excel 2007: The Missing Manual covers the entire gamut of how to build spreadsheets, add and format information, print reports, create charts and graphics, and use basic formulas and functions. Like its siblings in the Missing Manual series, this book crackles with a fine sense of humor and refreshing objectivity about its subject, guiding readers through the new Excel with clear explanations, step-by-step instructions, lots of illustrations, and friendly, time-saving advice. It's a perfect primer for small businesses with no techie to turn to, as well as those who want to organize household and office information.

#!The notion of &epsilon;-sample, as introduced by Amenta and Bern, has proven to be a key concept in the theory of sampled surfaces. Of particular interest is the fact that, if E is an &epsilon;-sample of a smooth surface S for a sufficiently small &epsilon;, then the Delaunay triangulation of E restricted to S is a good approximation of S, both in a topological and in a geometric sense. Hence, if one can construct an &epsilon;-sample, one also gets a good approximation of the surface. Moreover, correct reconstruction is ensured by various algorithms.In this paper, we introduce the notion of loose &epsilon;-sample. We show that the set of loose &epsilon;-samples contains and is asymptotically identical to the set of &epsilon;-samples. The main advantage of loose &epsilon;-samples over &epsilon;-samples is that they are easier to check and to construct. We also present a simple algorithm that constructs provably good surface samples and meshes.

#!A method is proposed for object search in cluttered color and/or depth scene, which is based on color reach histogram. The histogram features an image by the distribution of pixel colors with their two- and three-dimensional locations. In real situation, it is sometimes difficult to keep illumination unchanged or stable, and then color distributions can address an another effective cue for object identification. The color reach histograms reveal strong robustness for illumination change and/or on-plane rotation. In comparison with conventional histogram-based methods, the stability and robustness in object search and tracking could be obtained and verified through many experiments with real objects.

#!We present a data structure for the representation of filamentary volumetric data, called the L-block. While the L-block can be used to represent arbitrary volume data sets, it is particularly geared towards representing long, thin, branching structures that prior volumetric representations have difficulty dealing with efficiently. The data structure is designed to allow for easy compression, storage, segmentation, and reconstruction of volumetric data such as scanned neuronal data. By "polymerizing" adjacent connected voxels into connected components, L-block construction facilitates real-time data compression and segmentation, as well as subsequent geometric modeling and visualization of embedded objects within the volume data set. We describe its application in the context of reconstruction of brain microstructure at a neuronal level of detail.

#!A CAD-oriented system is proposed for the design of complex-shaped functional cloth, provided with a physics-based modelling core for simulation and virtual prototyping tasks. Textiles are physically modelled as particle grids in 3D space subjected to Newtonian dynamics, with internal spring, bending and shear forces derived from KES-F data measuring material behaviour. Interactions with the environment are expressed as external forces, collisions against obstacles, self-collisions and constraints. Differently from physics-based animation systems, the proposed system is conceived for real design purposes, and includes functionalities emulating the construction process of actual clothing and structural textiles, e.g., mesh sewing/assembly, insertion of small components, multi-layered fabric composition, mechanical shape deformation, and 2D-to-3D mapping methods. As applications, several cases of textile configurations are considered, with geometric models directly provided by industrial companies and presenting different levels of design complexities, such as garment models (e.g., men's jackets) for the clothing sector, or functional textiles used in the automotive industry (e.g., soft car tops).

#!This paper reported the effect of seed layer stress on the fabrication of monolithic polymer-metal MEMS microstructure and what is a better material for the seed layer. The monolithic microstructure is gaining more and more attentions in MEMS application, especially in three-dimensional microstructure and inkjet printhead. The polymer&#x2013;metal MEMS microstructure can be fabricated by combining the lithography and electroforming technologies. It is an integrated technology by batch process at low cost. The metal seed layer with large stress will lead to cracks and failure during the process integration. Several metal materials and thicknesses were studied to find a better candidate as the seed layer for the monolithic MEMS microstructure. The relationship between the monolithic MEMS structure and seed layer selection is also discussed. The lower residual stress of seed layer will result in a better surface condition for the followed integration process. The pure Ti metal and two-layer Ti/Au composite are the better seed layer materials in this study for the followed electroforming process of the monolithic polymer-metal MEMS microstructure.

It is shown how the Forward- and Viterbi-algorithms can be directly integrated in the proxel-method. The possibility of integrating the more complex Baum-Welch-algorithm is theoretically addressed. Experiments are conducted to determine the practicability of the new approach and to illustrate the type of analysis that is possible.

For this reason, government agencies (such as the FCC for the US) usually sell or rent, for example by auction, each operator a frequency band for its exclusive usage in a given country or region. Only a small part of the whole spectrum is allocated as a shared spectrum, in which networks function in the same (unlicensed) frequency band.

A sales forecasting system is required to respond to the versatile textile market and the needs of the distributors. Nowadays, due to the specific constraints of the textile sales (numerous and new items, short life time), existing forecasting models are generally unsuitable or unusable. We propose a forecasting system, based on clustering and classification tools, which performs mid-term forecasting. Performances of our models are evaluated using real data from an important French textile distributor.

#*Handling distributed authorization with delegation through answer set programming

#cInternational Journal of Information Security
#index6666
#!Distributed authorization is an essential issue in computer security. Recent research shows that trust management is a promising approach for the authorization in distributed environments. There are two key issues for a trust management system: how to design an expressive high-level policy language and how to solve the compliance-checking problem (Blaze et&#x00a0;al. in Proceedings of the Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 164&#x2013;173, 1996; Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Financial Cryptography (FC&#x2019;98). LNCS, vol.1465, pp. 254&#x2013;274, 1998), where ordinary logic programming has been used to formalize various distributed authorization policies (Li et&#x00a0;al. in Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, pp. 114&#x2013;130, 2002; ACM Trans. Inf. Syst. Secur. (TISSEC) 6(1):128&#x2013;171, 2003). In this paper, we employ Answer Set Programming to deal with many complex issues associated with the distributed authorization along the trust management approach. In particular, we propose a formal authorization language $$\mathcal {AL}$$ providing its semantics through Answer Set Programming. Using language $$\mathcal {AL}$$, we cannot only express nonmonotonic delegation policies which have not been considered in previous approaches, but also represent the delegation with depth, separation of duty, and positive and negative authorizations. We also investigate basic computational properties related to our approach. Through two case studies. we further illustrate the application of our approach in distributed environments.

In general, the measured area is different from the true area where the target image exists. Thus a snake, which can extract the shape of the target image, is utilized to renew the measured area. By processing this renewal iteratively, the area obtained by the snake converges to the true area and as a result the proposed method can accurately reconstruct a target image even when the measured area is different from the true area. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

#!A conceptual model of knowledge/information (K/I) search and transfer was developed; it was based on three concepts: managers' preferences for internal versus external sources, the importance of relationships between sources and recipients, and the derived managerial benefit. The results of an empirical study demonstrated a high degree of explained variance in managerial benefit and suggested managers' preferences for external sources over internal ones. They also supported the notion that managers use internal, known knowledge search to enhance their reputation and status. These results suggested a shift away from the conventional wisdom of internal preference that is reflected in theories of in-group favoritism and out-group derogation.

#!The aim of this article is to consider a new linear programming and two goal programming models for two-group classification problems. When these approaches are applied to the data of real life or of simulation, our proposed new models perform well both in separating the groups and the group-membership predictions of new objects. In discriminant analysis some linear programming models determine the attribute weights and the cut-off value in two steps, but our models determine simultaneously all of these values in one step. Moreover, the results of simulation experiments show that our proposed models outperform significantly than existing linear programming and statistical approaches in attaining higher average hit-ratios.

#!This paper deals with the problem of safety verification of nonlinear hybrid systems. We start from a classical method that uses interval arithmetic to check whether trajectories can move over the boundaries in a rectangular grid. We put this method into an abstraction refinement framework and improve it by developing an additional refinement step that employs interval-constraint propagation to add information to the abstraction without introducing new grid elements. Moreover, the resulting method allows switching conditions, initial states, and unsafe states to be described by complex constraints, instead of sets that correspond to grid elements. Nevertheless, the method can be easily implemented, since it is based on a well-defined set of constraints, on which one can run any constraint propagation-based solver. Tests of such an implementation are promising.

#!Groovy, the brand-new language for the Java platform, brings to Java many of the features that have made Ruby popular. Groovy in Action is a comprehensive guide to Groovy programming, introducing Java developers to the new dynamic features that Groovy provides. To bring you Groovy in Action, Manning again went to the source by working with a team of expert authors including both members and the Manager of the Groovy Project team. The result is the true definitive guide to the new Groovy language. Groovy in Action introduces Groovy by example, presenting lots of reusable code while explaining the underlying concepts. Java developers new to Groovy find a smooth transition into the dynamic programming world. Groovy experts gain a solid reference that challenges them to explore Groovy deeply and creatively.Because Groovy is so new, most readers will be learning it from scratch. Groovy in Action quickly moves through the Groovy basics, including: Simple and collective Groovy data types Working with Closures and Groovy Control Structures Dynamic Object Orientation, Groovy style Readers are presented with rich and detailed examples illustrating Groovy's enhancements to Java, including How to Work with Builders and the GDK Database programming with Groovy Groovy in Action then demonstrates how to Integrate Groovy with XML, and provides, Tips and Tricks Unit Testing and Build Support Groovy on Windows An additional bonus is a chapter dedicated to Grails, the Groovy Web Application Framework.Early PDF chapters of Groovy in Action are available from the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP) at http://www.manning.com/koenig. As part of this program, readers can also discuss the early manuscript with the author and help shape the manuscript as it's being developed by joining the Author Forum.

#!We study the economic interests of a wireless access point owner and his paying client, and model their interaction as a dynamic game. The key feature of this game is that the players have asymmetric information-the client knows more than the access provider. We find that if a client has a "web browser" utility function (a temporal utility function that grows linearly), it is a Nash equilibrium for the provider to charge the client a constant price per unit time. On the other hand, if the client has a "file transferor" utility function (a utility function that is a step function), the client would be unwilling to pay until the final time slot of the file transfer. We also study an expanded game where an access point sells to a reseller, which in turn sells to a mobile client and show that if the client has a web browser utility function, that constant price is a Nash equilibrium of the three player game. Finally, we study a two player game in which the access point does not know whether he faces a web browser or file transferor type client, and show conditions for which it is not a Nash equilibrium for the access point to maintain a constant price.

#!Published scientific articles are linked together into a graph, the citation graph, through their citations. This paper explores the notion of similarity based on connectivity alone, and proposes several algorithms to quantify it. Our metrics take advantage of the local neighborhoods of the nodes in the citation graph. Two variants of link-based similarity estimation between two nodes are described, one based on the separate local neighborhoods of the nodes, and another based on the joint local neighborhood expanded from both nodes at the same time. The algorithms are implemented and evaluated on a subgraph of the citation graph of computer science in a retrieval context. The results are compared with text-based similarity, and demonstrate the complementarity of link-based and text-based retrieval.

#!This editorial analyzes from a variety of perspectives the controversial issue of single-blind versus double-blind reviewing. In single-blind reviewing, the reviewer is unknown to the author, but the identity of the author is known to the reviewer. Double-blind reviewing is more symmetric: The identity of the author and the reviewer are not revealed to each other. We first examine the significant scholarly literature regarding blind reviewing. We then list six benefits claimed for double-blind reviewing and 21 possible costs. To compare these benefits and costs, we propose a double-blind policy for TODS that attempts to minimize the costs while retaining the core benefit of fairness that double-blind reviewing provides, and evaluate that policy against each of the listed benefits and costs. Following that is a general discussion considering several questions: What does this have to do with TODS, does bias exist in computer science, and what is the appropriate decision procedure&quest; We explore the &ldquo;knobs&rdquo; a policy design can manipulate to fine-tune a double-blind review policy. This editorial ends with a specific decision.

#!This paper presents a fast elemental image generation algorithm, called the Viewpoint Vector Rendering (VVR), for the computer-generated integral imaging system. VVR produces a set of elemental images in real-time by assembling the segmented area of the directional scenes taken from a range of viewpoints. This algorithm is less affected by system factors such as the number of elemental lens and the number of polygons. It also supports all display modes of the integral imaging system, real, virtual and focused mode. This paper first describes the characteristics of integral imaging system. It then discusses the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of the VVR algorithm, which can be easily adapted to render the integral images of complex 3D objects.

#!This paper presents a method for real-time 3D human tracking based on the particle filter by incorporating environment models. We track a human head represented with its 3D position and orientation by integrating the multiple cues from a set of distributed sensors. In particular, the multi-viewpoint color and depth images obtained from distributed stereo camera systems and the 3D shape of an indoor environment measured with a range sensor are used as the cues for 3D human head tracking. The 3D shape of an indoor environment allows us to assume the existing probability of a human head (we call this probability the environment model). While tracking the human head, we consider the environment model to improve the robustness of tracking in addition to the multi-camera's color and depth images. These cues including the environment model are used in the hypothesis evaluation and integrated naturally into the particle filter framework. The effectiveness of our proposed method is verified through experiments in a real environment. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!Although much research has focused on factors driving the turnover behaviors of information technology (IT) professionals once they are in an employment relationship, little is known about their ex ante intentions to stay when embarking on a new employment relationship. The present study investigates the effects of individual and situational factors on the turnover intentions of new entrants into the IT workforce. Arguably, the IT revolution of the past decade, both at its peak as well as its decline, has changed the expectations and values of this population of workers considerably. Adopting an interactionist perspective, we examine the interaction between individual preferences for organizational risk and variety, and the level of entrepreneurial risk inherent in the business model of a given employer together with the amount of variety that IT work with that employer offers. The posited relationships are tested in a policy capturing experiment with graduating information systems majors as subjects. The results provide support for the interactionist perspective, while at the same time questioning its basic premise.

#!We study the mean square weighted L2 discrepancy of randomized digital (t, m, s)-nets over Zp. The randomization method considered here is a digital shift of depth m, i.e., for each coordinate the first m digits of each point are shifted by the same shift, whereas the remaining digits in each coordinate are shifted independently for each point. We also consider a simplified version of this shift.We give a formula for the mean square weighted L2 discrepancy using the generating matrices of the digital net and we prove an upper bound on this discrepancy. Further we investigate how the constant of the leading term depends on the choice of the base p.

#!The eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian are used to generate three different sets of features for shape recognition and classification in binary images. The generated features are rotation-, translation-, and size-invariant. The features are also shown to be tolerant of noise and boundary deformation. These features are used to classify hand-drawn, synthetic, and natural shapes with correct classification rates ranging from 88.9% to 99.2%. The classification was done using few features (only two features in some cases) and simple feedforward neural networks or minimum Euclidian distance.

#cInformation Fusion
#index6793
#!The Information Fusion (IF) process is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, particularly through the incorporation of methods for high-level reasoning when applied to the situation analysis domain. A fundamental component of the IF process is a database (or databases) containing a priori knowledge that lists expected objects, behaviors of objects, and relationships between objects as well as all the possible attributes that can be inferred from measurements coming from a given sensor suite. We first present the basic concept of an existing support database (consisting of more than 2200 platforms) for Identity information fusion, and discuss its extension for higher-level fusion (e.g. situation and threat assessment). The database contains all the salient features needed for refining the identity of any target by the fusion of sensor information, and for addressing the situation and threat posed by groups of objects. The database is especially well suited for use in a Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning scheme although it can also be used with Bayesian reasoning, if a priori probability distributions are known. Convincing results on several realistic scenarios of Maritime Air Area Operations and Direct Fleet Support are presented. This paper then develops the advanced concept of a Knowledge Management and Exploitation Server (KNOWMES) to support the IF process, through the use of ontologies and heterogeneous knowledge sources, which are necessary for higher level fusion.

#!To respond quickly to the rapidly changing manufacturing environment, it is imperative for the system to have such capabilities as flexibility, adaptability, and reusability. The fractal manufacturing system (FrMS) is a new manufacturing paradigm designed to meet these requirements. To facilitate a dynamic reconfiguration of system elements (i.e., fractals), agents as well as software modules should be self-reconfigurable. Embodiment of a self-reconfigurable manufacturing system can be achieved by using self-reconfigurable software architecture. In this paper, therefore, self-reconfigurable software architecture is designed by conducting the following studies: (1) analysis of functional requirements of a fractal and environmental constraints, (2) design of reconfigurable software architecture especially for a reconfigurable agent, (3) selection of proper techniques to implement software modules, and realization of software architecture equipped with self-reconfigurability. To validate this approach, the designed architecture is applied to the FrMS.

#!Intelligent scissors is an interactive image segmentation algorithm which allows a user to select piece-wise globally optimal contour segment corresponding to a desired object boundary. However, the intelligent scissors is too sensitive to a noise and texture patterns in an image since it utilizes the gradient information concerning the pixel intensities. This paper describes a new intelligent scissors based on the concept of the separability in order to improve the object boundary extraction performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed by some experiments for actual images acquired by an ordinary digital camera.

#!This book is an excellent introduction to the topics of microprogram control and emulation. It is well-organized and easy to read. The author uses a simple hypothetical machine to explain the basic concept of microprogram control. Then he proceeds to give a very detailed description of an actual microprocessor (the Burroughs D-machine), and uses this machine to introduce emulation concepts. The TRANSLANG microprogramming language for the D-machine is described, and is used to generate many sample microprograms showing emulation techniques. These sample microprograms were actually executed via a D-machine simulator, and the results of the simulation runs are given in the book along with the sample microprograms. The book is to have a companion instructor's manual which will contain FORTRAN IV listings of the TRANSLANG compiler and D-machine simulator -- ideal for use in a course on microprogramming.

#!Interest in the topic of microprogramming appears to have had a great growth in the middle and late 1960's, but since that time it has leveled off or declined somewhat. This paper examines the reasons behind this development and then offers a reconsideration of and a new proposal for the definition of microprogramming.This result is supported by the consideration of three phenomena. First is the evolution of microprogramming during the past twenty years. Second is the evolution in the use of interpretation as an implementation technique. Third is the set of "rules of thumb" resulting from the system designer having to resolve conflicting forces attempting to influence his activity.Five possible meanings of the term microprogramming are considered and rejected totally or in part prior to the one finally offered. The suggestion is made that this redefined concept be avoided as much as possible in the future, and two avenues for research alternatives are encouraged instead.

#index6858
#!In this paper we show how to use stochastic estimation methods to investigate topological properties of sensor networks as well as the behavior of dynamical processes on these networks. The framework is particularly important to study problems for which no theoretical results are known, or cannot be directly applied in practice, for instance, when only asymptotic results are available. We also interpret Russo's formula in the context of sensor networks and thus obtain practical information on their reliability. As a case study, we analyze a localization protocol for wireless sensor networks and validate our approach by numerical experiments. Finally, we mention three applications of our approach: estimating the number of pivotal sensors in a real network, minimizing the number of such sensors for robustness purposes during the network design and estimating the distance between successive localized positions for mobile sensor networks.

#!Because of its small faculty (six professors in Computer Science), Brown does not offer a complete course in microprogramming. A substantial portion of the third semester in the Computer Science sequence is devoted to aspects of microprogramming. Microprogramming is treated as merely another level in the hierarchy running from the hardware to programs written in higher level languages. The student has already had substantial experience in the design and implementation of gates, registers, adders and the like. Using a simulator written in APL he has designed and implemented a simple control unit, and arithmetic/logic unit, and a random access memory. He has written several programs in both PL/I and BAL. In the third semester, the microprogramming system available on one of the computers at Brown (either a DSC Meta 4 or an Interdata Model 3) is covered and he codes and debugs one of the more complicated instructions (i.e., Translate and Test or Search Linked List or Table).

#index6878
#%312201
#!The design of rail infrastructure is a difficult task. Many parties are involved, and the tasks range from stakeholder issues to very detailed technical questions, such as control design. Simulation studies are often applied during infrastructure control system design, but the application of simulation is quite hard. One of the problems is the lack of flexibility in linking to information systems and databases. Another problem is that there are many potential users of the models, while most simulation systems can only be used by one user at a time. In addition, the tightly coupled structure of models makes model reuse and model maintenance hard. To overcome these problems, a service oriented simulation architecture is proposed for rail infrastructure modeling. The object-oriented simulation libraries that have been created within this architecture have been tested in a real project to estimate rail infrastructure capacity, and proved to work well.

#!In a recent educational technical note in SIGMAP, [3], Swanson and Woolsey outlined how one can determine the unknown parameters of a linear model under the criterion of minimizing the sum of absolute deviations. This note will demonstrate that one can also use linear programming procedures under the criterion of minimizing the maximum absolute deviation. This transformation to a linear programming problem is known, but not of wide extent; and is useful when one is trying to identify "outliers".

#@Birgitte Holm Sørensen,Oluf Danielsen,Janni Nielsen
#t2007
#cEducation and Information Technologies
#index6883
#!This paper builds on a key finding of a 5-year Danish research project con-cerning children in the 7 to 15 age group: children's principal use of computers and the internet takes place in their spare time, and it is during their spare time that the majority of children really learn how to use interactive media. The project shows that in children's spare-time use of ICT they employ informal forms of learning based to a large extent on their social interaction both in physical and virtual spaces. These informal learning forms can be identified as learning hierarchies, learning communities and learning networks; they are important contributions to the school of the knowledge society. The ICT in New Learning Environments project based on anthropologically inspired methods and social learning theories shows that students bring their informal forms of learning into the school context. This happens particularly when the school has undergone physical alterations and when its organisation of learning and teaching are also restructured, with project-based learning becoming an important part of the school work and with the media available in the learning environment. Using organisation theory, the school working with ICT and project-based learning is shown to simultaneously constitute a mixed mode between the school of the industrial and the knowledge society. The research shows that it is possible to tip the balance in the direction of the school of the knowledge society, and thus of the future, by comprehensively using ICT and project work in the day-to-day activities of the school, alongside and integrated with the traditional forms of learning, and not least by employing the informal learning processes children develop outside school. For teachers this will mean an extension of their function: no longer merely communicators of knowledge, they will have to become knowledge managers and overall leaders of projects, and this entails much more dialogue with the pupils.

#!The complexity of various membership problems for tree automata on compressed trees is analyzed. Two compressed representations are considered: dags, which allow to share identical subtrees in a tree, and straight-line context-free tree grammars, which moreover allow to share identical intermediate parts in a tree. Several completeness results for the classes NL, P, and PSPACE are obtained. Finally, the complexity of the evaluation problem for (structural) XPath queries on trees that are compressed via straight-line context-free tree grammars is investigated.

#!This paper presents a stochastic traffic signal optimization method that consists of the CORSIM microscopic traffic simulation model and a heuristic optimizer. For the heuristic optimizer, the performance of three widely used optimization methods (i.e., genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and OptQuest Engine) was compared using a real world test corridor with 12 signalized intersections in Fairfax, Virginia, USA. The performance of the proposed stochastic optimization method was compared with an existing signal timing optimization program, SYNCHRO, under microscopic simulation environment. The results indicated that the genetic algorithm-based optimization method outperforms the SYNCHRO program as well as the other stochastic optimization methods in the optimization of traffic signal timings for the test corridor.

#index6906
#!Summary: To allow efficient and systematic retrieval of statements from Medline we have developed EBIMed, a service that combines document retrieval with co-occurrence-based analysis of Medline abstracts. Upon keyword query, EBIMed retrieves the abstracts from EMBL-EBI's installation of Medline and filters for sentences that contain biomedical terminology maintained in public bioinformatics resources. The extracted sentences and terminology are used to generate an overview table on proteins, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, drugs and species used in the same biological context. All terms in retrieved abstracts and extracted sentences are linked to their entries in biomedical databases. We assessed the quality of the identification of terms and relations in the retrieved sentences. More than 90% of the protein names found indeed represented a protein. According to the analysis of four protein--protein pairs from the Wnt pathway we estimated that 37% of the statements containing such a pair mentioned a meaningful interaction and clarified the interaction of Dkk with LRP. We conclude that EBIMed improves access to information where proteins and drugs are involved in the same biological process, e.g. statements with GO annotations of proteins, protein--protein interactions and effects of drugs on proteins.

#cBioinformatics
#index6910
#!Summary: The KGraph is a data visualization system that has been developed to display the complex relationships between the univariate and bivariate associations among an outcome of interest, a set of covariates, and a set of genetic factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It allows for easy viewing and interpretation of genetic associations, correlations among covariates and SNPs, and information about the replication and cross-validation of the associations. The KGraph allows the user to more easily investigate multicollinearity and confounding through visualization of the multidimensional correlation structure underlying genetic associations. It emphasizes gene--environment and gene--gene interaction, both important components of any genetic system that are often overlooked in association frameworks.

#!Splitting and importance sampling are the two primary techniques to make important rare events happen more frequently in a simulation, and obtain an unbiased estimator with much smaller variance than the standard Monte Carlo estimator. Importance sampling has been discussed and studied in several articles presented at the Winter Simulation Conference in the past. A smaller number of WSC articles have examined splitting. In this paper, we review the splitting technique and discuss some of its strengths and limitations from the practical viewpoint. We also introduce improvements in the implementation of the multilevel splitting technique. This is done in a setting where we want to estimate the probability of reaching B before reaching (or returning to) A when starting from a fixed state x0 &isin; B, where A and B are two disjoint subsets of the state space and B is very rarely attained. This problem has several practical applications.

#!Motivation: ANOVA is a technique, which is frequently used in the analysis of microarray data, e.g. to assess the significance of treatment effects, and to select interesting genes based on P-values. However, it does not give information about what exactly is causing the effect. Our purpose is to improve the interpretation of the results from ANOVA on large microarray datasets, by applying PCA on the individual variance components. Interaction effects can be visualized by biplots, showing genes and variables in one plot, providing insight in the effect of e.g. treatment or time on gene expression. Because ANOVA has removed uninteresting sources of variance, the results are much more interpretable than without ANOVA. Moreover, the combination of ANOVA and PCA provides a simple way to select genes, based on the interactions of interest. Results: It is shown that the components from an ANOVA model can be summarized and visualized with PCA, which improves the interpretability of the models. The method is applied to a real time-course gene expression dataset of mesenchymal stem cells. The dataset was designed to investigate the effect of different treatments on osteogenesis. The biplots generated with the algorithm give specific information about the effects of specific treatments on genes over time. These results are in agreement with the literature. The biological validation with GO annotation from the genes present in the selections shows that biologically relevant groups of genes are selected. Availability: R code with the implementation of the method for this dataset is available from http://www.cac.science.ru.nl under the heading "Software". Contact: L.Buydens@science.ru.nl

#!A hands-on guide to testing techniques that deliver reliable software and systems Testing even a simple system can quickly turn into a potentially infinite task. Faced with tight costs and schedules, testers need to have a toolkit of practical techniques combined with hands-on experience and the right strategies in order to complete a successful project. World-renowned testing expert Rex Black provides you with the proven methods and concepts that test professionals must know. He presents you with the fundamental techniques for testing and clearly shows you how to select and apply successful strategies to test a system with budget and time constraints. Black begins by discussing the goals and tactics of effective and efficient testing. Next, he lays the foundation of his technique for risk-based testing, explaining how to analyze, prioritize, and document risks to the quality of the system using both informal and formal techniques. He then clearly describes how to design, develop, and, ultimately, document various kinds of tests. Because this is a hands-on activity, Black includes realistic, life-sized exercises that illustrate all of the major test techniques with detailed solutions. By the end of this book, you'll know more about the nuts and bolts of testing than most testers learn in an entire career, and you'll be ready to put those ideas into action on your next test project. With the help of real-world examples integrated throughout the chapters, you'll discover how to: * Analyze the risks to system quality * Allocate your testing effort appropriately based on the level of risk * Choose the right testing strategies every time * Design tests based on a system's expected behavior (black box) or internal structure (white box) * Plan and perform integration testing * Explore and attack the system * Focus your hard work to serve the needs of the project The author's companion Web site provides exercises, tips, and techniques that can be used to gain valuable experience and effectively test software and systems.

#!In this paper, we present a modified genetic algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The modified genetic algorithm in which crossover and mutation are performed conditionally instead of probabilistically has higher global and local search ability and is more easily applied to a problem than the conventional genetic algorithms. Three optimization problems are used to test the performances of the modified genetic algorithm. Experimental studies show that the modified genetic algorithm produces better results over the conventional one and other methods.

#!The volume, location of the centroid, and second-order moments of a three-dimensional star-shaped object are determined in terms of the spherical harmonic coefficients of its boundary function. Bounds on the surface area of the object are derived in terms of the spherical harmonic coefficients as well. Sufficient conditions under which the moments and area computed from the truncated spherical harmonic series converge to the actual moments and area are established. The proposed method is verified using a scanned head model and by recent measurements of the 433 Eros asteroid. An extension to non-star-shaped objects of genus 0 is provided. The computational complexity of our method is shown to be equal to that of the discrete spherical harmonic transform, which is O(N^2log^2N), where N is the maximum order of coefficients retained in the expansion.

#!In this paper, we present a framework for providing fair service and supporting quality of service (QoS) requirements in IEEE 802.11 networks with multiple access points (APs). These issues becomes critical as IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN are widely deployed in nationwide networks, linking tens of thousands of "hotspots" for providing both real-time (voice) and non real-time (data) services to a large population of mobile users. However, both fairness and QoS guarantees cannot be supported in the current 802.11 standard.Our system, termed MiFi, relies on centralized coordination of the APs. During any given time of the "contention-free" period only a set of non-interfering APs is activated while the others are silenced. Moreover, the amount of service granted to an AP is proportional to its load and the system's performance is optimized by employing efficient scheduling algorithms. We show that such a system can be implemented without requiring any modification of the underlying MAC protocol standard or the behavior of the mobile stations. Our scheme is complementary to the emerging 802.11e standard for QoS and guarantees to overcome the hidden node and the overlapping cell problems. Our simulations establish that the system supports fairness and hence can provide QoS guarantees for real-time traffic, while maintaining a relative high throughput.

#!Preference-based search (PBS) is a popular approach for helping consumers find their desired items from online catalogs. Currently most PBS tools generate search results by a certain set of criteria based on preferences elicited from the current user during the interaction session. Due to the incompleteness and uncertainty of the user's preferences, the search results are often inaccurate and may contain items that the user has no desire to select. In this paper we develop an efficient Bayesian filter based on a group of users' past choice behavior and use it to refine the search results by filtering out items which are unlikely to be selected by the user. Our preliminary experiment shows that our approach is highly promising in generating more accurate search results and saving user's interaction effort.

#!The performance of computer systems can in theory be optimized by selecting the system configuration having the best simulated performance. Unfortunately, it is often computationally intractable to estimate the performance of all system configurations accurately via simulation. We propose an algorithm for finding the best system configuration without estimating the performance of each system configuration accurately, so that the total simulation time is minimized. We prove that with high probability our algorithm finds the best system configuration. In addition, our algorithm has an advantage in that it only infrequently changes the system configurations to be simulated. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm improves upon existing algorithms with respect to the total simulation time and the frequency of changing the system configurations.

More precisely, we show that after a 1-round initialization phase during which random bits are distributed among n players, it is possible to perform each of the k XOR computations using two rounds of communication.For $$t\leq c\sqrt{n/\log n}$$, for any c < 1/2, we design a protocol that uses O(kt2log n) random bits.

#!Worldwide there is an increasing demand for educational institutions to offer part of their educations online and mixed mode. For institutions to comply with these demands, it is necessary to prepare teachers (and other members of the staff), to fulfil their responsibilities within the virtual environment. Teachers must be able to organize their courses pedagogically according to different conditions, i.e., subject domains, group sizes, variations within communication and interaction. Teachers must acquire knowledge and skills in handling Information and Communication Techniques (ICT) as well as pedagogical possibilities and constraints inherited in the software available. Several studies demonstrate that technical obstacles are easier to overcome than lack of communication skills. Also the consequenses of communication breakdowns tend to create serious problems that technology cannot solve. These problems concern how teachers function satisfactory as mediators and coaches in collaborative, knowledge sharing virtual environments. For example, how teachers support their students in becoming online-students and how they facilitate complex discussions on difficult topics. This is a big challenge for everybody involved in e-learning, and the challenge is not met by offering introductory courses for university teachers. Based on basis of a recent examination of concrete actions and strategies for the future within 11 Danish universities, the auther argues that there exists a severe mismatch between the organisational expectations and strategies and the competence-evolving activities that the same organisations offer to their staff. A recent case study of a university pedagogy course on e-learning for university teachers demonstrates and identifies some of the consequences of the mismatch. Finally the author suggests strategies to meet the demands of the future online university.

#!The performance of many supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms is very sensitive to the choice of an appropriate distance metric. Previous work in metric learning and adaptation has mostly been focused on classification tasks by making use of class label information. In standard clustering tasks, however, class label information is not available. In order to adapt the metric to improve the clustering results, some background knowledge or side information is needed. One useful type of side information is in the form of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity information. Recently, some novel methods (e.g., the parametric method proposed by Xing et al.) for learning global metrics based on pairwise side information have been shown to demonstrate promising results. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method, called relaxational metric adaptation (RMA), for the same metric adaptation problem. While RMA is local in the sense that it allows locally adaptive metrics, it is also global because even patterns not in the vicinity can have long-range effects on the metric adaptation process. Experimental results for semi-supervised clustering based on both simulated and real-world data sets show that RMA outperforms Xing et al.'s method under most situations. Besides applying RMA to semi-supervised learning, we have also used it to improve the performance of content-based image retrieval systems through metric adaptation. Experimental results based on two real-world image databases show that RMA significantly outperforms other methods in improving the image retrieval performance.

#!Systems programs rely on fine-grain control of data representation and use of state to achieve performance, conformance to hard-ware specification, and temporal predictability. The robustness and checkability of these programs could be greatly improved if modern type systems and programming language ideas, such as polymorphism and type inference, could be applied to these programs.BitC is a higher-order programming language in the tradition of ML and Haskell, extended to incorporate both state and the expression of unboxed and low-level datatypes. State and unboxed value types interact in subtle ways with polymorphic type-inference. Unless handled with care in the language design, interactions of these features can lead to unsoundness or results that are counter-intuitive to the programmer. Because instances of value types may have mutable components, a decision must be made concerning their compatibility at copy boundaries: should structurally equivalent types that differ only in their mutability be considered compatible. The choice impacts both the amount of polymorphism that the language can preserve and the burden of type annotation imposed on the programmer.This paper presents some of these challenges and our design for how to address these issues.

Understanding this mental model will provide insight into developing mapping applications that present location information in a way that makes it easier to conceptualize and situate new location information in terms of places a person already knows. An analysis of hand-annotated maps showing the locations of prominent places in a person's mental map of Boston suggests that prominent places can be characterized by a certain set of properties and that major transit points (subway stops) play an important role in framing a person's mental map.

#!A central controller chooses a state-dependent transmission rate for each user in a fading, downlink channel by varying transmission power over time. For each user, the state of the channel evolves over time according to an exogenous continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), which affects the quality of transmission. The traffic for each user, arriving at the central controller, is modeled as a finite-buffer Markovian queue with adjustable service rates. That is, for each user data packets arrive to the central controller according to a Poisson process and packet size is exponentially distributed; an arriving packet is dropped if the associated buffer is full, which results in degradation of quality of service. The controller forwards (downlink) the arriving packets to the corresponding user according to an optimally chosen transmission rate from a fixed set A i of available values for each user i, depending on the backlog in the system and the channel state of all users. The objective is to maximize quality of service subject to an upper bound on the long-run average power consumption. We show that the optimal transmission rate for each user is solely a function of his own packet queue length and channel state; the dependence among users is captured through a penalty rate. Further, we explicitly characterize the optimal transmission rate for each user.

#index6993
#!Oscillation of a gas in closed resonators has gained considerable interest in the past years. In this paper, the nonlinear equations governing the behavior of the gas oscillations inside the resonator are formulated in a weak form and then modeled using the finite element method. The pressure ratios, predicted by the proposed model, are in close agreement with the exact solutions available for simple geometries such as cylindrical, exponential and linearly varying area resonators. The presented comparisons validate the accuracy of the finite element model and emphasize its potential for predicting the performance or resonators of more complex geometries which are necessary for generating high pressures from the standing waves. Also, gas flow through the boundaries of the resonator is implemented in the proposed model. The presented finite element model presents an invaluable tool for designing a new class of acoustic compressors which can be used, for example, in refrigeration and vibration control applications.

#!Making a saccadic eye movement involves two decisions, the decision to initiate the saccade and the selection of the visual target of the saccade. Here we provide a theoretical account for the time-courses of these two processes, whose instabilities are the basis of decision making. We show how the cross-over from spatial averaging for fast saccades to selection for slow saccades arises from the balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes. Initiating a saccade involves overcoming fixation, as can be observed in the countermanding paradigm, which we model accounting both for the temporal evolution of the suppression probability and its dependence on fixation activity. The interaction between the two forms of decision making is demonstrated by predicting how the cross-over from averaging to selection depends on the fixation stimulus in gap-step-overlap paradigms. We discuss how the activation dynamics of our model may be mapped onto neuronal structures including the motor map and the fixation cells in superior colliculus.

#!During the past years the involvement of emotions in dialogue design has attracted much interest in current research on intelligent human-computer interfaces. We focus on the implementation of a flexible and robust dialogue system which integrates emotions and other influencing parameters in the dialogue flow. In order to achieve a higher degree of adaptability we propose a simplified stochastic approach to model the dialogue manager's behavior based on the user's input and dialogue-influencing parameters like emotions.

#%614741
#!We consider the flow of a thin layer of incompressible fluid on a rotating sphere, bounded internally by the surface of the sphere and externally by a free surface. Progressive-wave solutions are sought for this problem, without tangent plane simplifications. A linearized theory is derived for small amplitude perturbations about a base westerly flow field, allowing calculation of the linearized progressive wavespeed. This result is then extended to the numerical solution of the full model, to obtain highly non-linear large-amplitude progressive-wave solutions in the form of Fourier series. A detailed picture is developed of how the progressive wavespeed depends on wave amplitude. This approach reveals the presence of non-linear resonance behaviour, with different disjointed solution branches existing at different values of the amplitude. Additionally, we show that the formation of localized low pressure systems cut off from the main flow field is an inherent feature of the non-linear dynamics, once the amplitude forcing reaches a certain critical level.

#!This paper presents a method for simulating the two-way interaction between fluids and deformable solids. The fluids are simulated using an incompressible Eulerian formulation where a linear pressure projection on the fluid velocities enforces mass conservation. Similarly, elastic solids are simulated using a semi-implicit integrator implemented as a linear operator applied to the forces acting on the nodes in Lagrangian formulation. The proposed method enforces coupling constraints between the fluid and the elastic systems by combining both the pressure projection and implicit integration steps into one set of simultaneous equations. Because these equations are solved simultaneously the resulting combined system treats closed regions in a physically correct fashion, and has good stability characteristics allowing for relatively large time steps. This general approach is not tied to any particular volume discretization of fluid or solid, and we present results implemented using both regular-grid and tetrahedral simulations.

#!In this paper, we introduce the FLUX interconnection networks, a scheme where the interconnections of a parallel system are established on demand before or during program execution. We present a programming paradigm which can be utilized to make the proposed solution feasible. We perform several experiments to show the viability of our approach and the potential performance gain of using the most suitable network configuration for a given parallel program. We experiment on several case studies, evaluate different algorithms, developed for meshes or trees, and map them on ''grid''-like or reconfigurable physical interconnection networks. Our results clearly show that, based on the underlying network, different mappings are suitable for different algorithms. Even for a single algorithm different mappings are more appropriate, when the processing data size, the number of utilized nodes or the hardware cost of the processing elements changes. The implication of the above is that changing interconnection topologies/mappings (dynamically) on demand depending on the program needs can be beneficial.

In particular we require that for a parameter &#x03bd; &#x2265; 1, no component contains more than &#x03bd; &#x00b7; n/k of the graph vertices.For k = 2 and &#x03bd; = 1 this problem is equivalent to the well-known Minimum Bisection problem for which an approximation algorithm with a polylogarithmic approximation guarantee has been presented in [FK]. For arbitrary k and &#x03bd; &#x2265; 2 a bicriteria approximation ratio of O(log n) was obtained by Even et al. [ENRS1] using the spreading metrics technique.We present a bicriteria approximation algorithm that for any constant &#x03bd; > 1 runs in polynomial time and guarantees an approximation ratio of O(log1.5n) (for a precise statement of the main result see Theorem 6). For &#x03bd; = 1 and k &#x2265; 3 we show that no polynomial time approximation algorithm can guarantee a finite approximation ratio unless P = NP.

#!Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) network is an unsupervised learning neural network that maps an n-dimensional input data to a lower dimensional output map while maintaining the original topological relations. The extended SOM network further groups the nodes on the output map into a user specified number of clusters. In this research effort, we applied this extended version of SOM networks to a consumer data set from American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). Results using the AT&T data indicate that the extended SOM network performs better than the two-step procedure that combines factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis in uncovering market segments.

#!Several classifiers for forward looking infra-red imagery are designed and implemented, and their relative performance is benchmarked on 2545 images belonging to 8 different ship classes, from which 11 attributes are extracted. These are a Bayes classifier, a Dempster-Shafer classifier ensemble in which specialized classifiers are optimized to return a single ship class, a k-nearest neighbor classifier, and an optimized neural net classifier. Two different methods are then studied to fuse the results of selected subsets of these classifiers. The first method consists of using the outputs of various classifiers as inputs to a second neural net fuser. The second method consists of converting the outputs of these classifiers into masses for use in a Dempster-Shafer fuser. In both approaches, the fused classifier achieves better results than the best classifier for any given class.

#!Fed up with the high tolls charged by your ordinary telephone service? If you're itching to cut the copper cord with your costly, traditional phone service, you need Talk is Cheap, the new, easy-to-understand guide to understanding and using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and other Internet telephone options. Technologies such as VoIP are gaining a great deal of attention these days as more people switch from standard telephone service to phone service via the Internet. But while the cost savings are outstanding, there are some issues with Internet telephony that you should know about. Are the connections reliable? Is the quality comparable? Will it include 911 services? James Gaskin's Talk is Cheap addresses these issues and many more by explaining how to make the switch and what the tradeoffs will be if you opt for Internet telephony over traditional phone services. Talk is Cheap focuses on the increasingly popular services from Vonage, which uses VoIP, and Skype--a free service that operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network with the ability to turn any PC, Mac, or Pocket PC into a telephone. The book explains your options; explores the background behind, the workings of, and differences between VoIP and P2P networks; and discusses the advantages and drawbacks of both technologies (including service offerings, quality, capabilities, completion rates, and more). Talk is Cheap then goes into detail on what you can expect in Internet service from traditional phone companies such as Verizon and AT&T. In addition, you will learn more advanced techniques, including how to turn your Palm or Pocket PC into an Internet phone and how to work with Wi-Fi phones and videophones. A straightforward, quick introduction to the ins and outs of using Internet telephone services, this book provides everything you need to make informed telephone decisions--whether you're thinking about the switch from traditional phone service or have already made it and want to get the most out of your new Internet telephone.

#!This paper studies the problem of determining facial orientation without correspondences in distortion-related infrared images. To improve estimation accuracy and reduce sensitivity to noise and unavoidable error, a simple and robust method based on the single linkage clustering is proposed to simultaneously detect inlier set and estimate orientation angle under contaminated data. An iterative strategy is adopted to avoid random choice of link distance in the single linkage clustering. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is substantially superior to the moment method. This method can also be extended to detect arbitrary objects with mirror symmetrical or nearly symmetrical property.

#!Geolocation of Internet hosts enables a new class of location-aware applications. Previous measurement-based approaches use reference hosts, called landmarks, with a well-known geographic location to provide the location estimation of a target host. This leads to a discrete space of answers, limiting the number of possible location estimates to the number of adopted landmarks. In contrast, we propose Constraint-Based Geolocation (CBG), which infers the geographic location of Internet hosts using multilateration with distance constraints to establish a continuous space of answers instead of a discrete one. However, to use multilateration in the Internet, the geographic distances from the landmarks to the target host have to be estimated based on delay measurements between these hosts. This is a challenging problem because the relationship between network delay and geographic distance in the Internet is perturbed by many factors, including queueing delays and the absence of great-circle paths between hosts. CBG accurately transforms delay measurements to geographic distance constraints, and then uses multilateration to infer the geolocation of the target host. Our experimental results show that CBG outperforms previous geolocation techniques. Moreover, in contrast to previous approaches, our method is able to assign a confidence region to each given location estimate. This allows a location-aware application to assess whether the location estimate is sufficiently accurate for its needs.

#*Dynamic Assignment of Gaussian Components in Modelling Speech Spectra

#t2006
#cJournal of VLSI Signal Processing Systems
#index7075
#!In this paper, we describe a parametric mixture model for modelling the resonant characteristics of the vocal tract where Gaussian distributions are used to model spectral frequency regions. A mixtures of Gaussian (MoG) based parametrisation scheme is used for modelling a smoothed representation of the spectra. This smoothing procedure removes all signal periodicity from the spectra allowing highly natural analysis, manipulation and synthesis of speech. The goal of this parametrisation scheme is to ease the correspondence between the resonant characteristics of the vocal tract and the parametric distributions and modelling the spectrum with an appropriate number of parameters. Previously, a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to this parametrisation scheme was introduced. However, this approach has inherent local optima problems. Noting that, a relatively small class of Gaussian densities can approximate a large class of distributions, we propose a new scheme whereby starting with a large number of distributions in the mixture, we systematically reduce their number and re-approximate the densities in the mixture based on a distance criterion. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance was found to allow optimal MoG solutions to the spectra. Furthermore, a fitness measure based on KL information is used to provide a figure for estimating the model order in representing formant-like features. The proposed model is subjectively evaluated and is shown to reduce the number of Gaussian with an appreciable loss in the quality of the re-synthesised speech.

#!Computational modeling of biological systems is becoming increasingly common as scientists attempt to understand biological phenomena in their full complexity. Here we distinguish between two types of biological models --- mathematical and computational--- according to their different representations of biological phenomena and their diverse potential. We call the approach of constructing computational models of biological systems Executable Biology, as it focuses on the design of executable computer algorithms that mimic biological phenomena. We give an overview of the main modeling efforts in this direction, and discuss some of the new challenges that executable biology poses for computer science and biology. We argue that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research, driving biology towards a more precise engineering discipline.

#!Beginning with BETA, a range of programming language mechanisms such as virtual classes (class-valued attributes of objects) have been developed to allow inheritance in the presence of mutually dependent classes. This paper presents Tribe, a type system which generalises and simplifies other formalisms of such mechanisms, by treating issues which are inessential for soundness, such as the precise details of dispatch and field initialisation, as orthogonal to the core formalism. Tribe can support path types dependent simultaneously on both classes and objects, which is useful for writing library code, and ubiquitous access to an object's family, which offers family polymorphism without the need to drag around family arguments. Languages based on Tribe will be both simpler and more expressive than existing designs, while having a simpler type system, serving as a useful basis for future language designs.

#index7092
#!The increase in availability and use of digital three-dimensional (3D) synthetic or scanned objects, makes the availability of basic database operations, such as retrieval, necessary. Retrieval methods are based on the extraction of a compact shape descriptor; the challenge is to design a shape descriptor that describes the original object in sufficient detail to make accurate 3D object retrieval possible. Building on previous work, this paper proposes a novel depth buffer-based shape descriptor (called PTK) that encompasses symmetry, eigenvalue-related weighting and an object thickness related measure to provide an accuracy surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. An evaluation of the novel method&#x2019;s parameters and a direct comparison to other approaches are carried out using publicly available and widely used databases.

#!In this talk we will discuss next generation data centers and the important impact they will have upon enterprise applications. Specifically, we will discuss the technical and economical trends motivating the move towards large scale distributed data centers consisting of tens of thousands of servers and hundreds of petabytes of storage. We will explain the roles and advantages of virtual machines and other virtualization technologies in these environments and also explore how they exacerbate the complexity of management and achieving predictable application behavior.To better illustrate issues emerging in such environments we will describe early experiments we conducted with a 1000-processor utility rendering service created for DreamWorks Animation that was used to render the films Shrek II and Madagascar. We will discuss the lessons learned from this experience.Next, we consider the trend towards service oriented architectures for enterprise application platforms. Service orientation provides for more flexible and agile information technology systems but further increases the complexity of management and behavior. We will explore the implications of composing services dynamically using an SOA approach.These trends for enterprise application platforms and the trends towards next generation data centers have helped to drive our current research agenda. Our goal is to enable the flexibility and agility offered by these new technologies while enabling cost effective management, predictable behavior and improved quality of service. We will give an overview of our research on model driven design for enterprise application infrastructure, automated deployment, and operations of distributed application services executing in a virtualized, shared resource pool within these next generation data centers.Finally, we will summarize the implications, challenges, and opportunities posed by these trends on academic and industrial research. In particular, we consider the impact on software performance and software performance engineering and pose important unanswered questions.

#!Because of stringent power constraints, aggressive latency-hiding approaches, such as prefetching, are absent in the state-of-the-art embedded processors. There are two main reasons that make prefetching power inefficient. First, compiler-inserted prefetch instructions increase code size and, therefore, could increase I-cache power. Second, inaccurate prefetching (especially for hardware prefetching) leads to high D-cache power consumption because of useless accesses. In this work, we show that it is possible to support power-efficient prefetching through bit-differential offset assignment. We target the prefetching of relocatable stack variables with a high degree of precision. By assigning the offsets of stack variables in such a way that most consecutive addresses differ by 1 bit, we can prefetch them with compact prefetch instructions to save I-cache power. The compiler first generates an access graph of consecutive memory references and then attempts a layout of the memory locations in the smallest hypercube. Each dimension of the hypercube represents a 1-bit differential addressing. The embedding is carried out in as compact a hypercube as possible in order to save memory space. Each load/store instruction carries a hint regarding prefetching the next memory reference by encoding its differential address with respect to the current one. To reduce D-cache power cost, we further attempt to assign offsets so that most of the consecutive accesses map to the same cache line. Our prefetching is done using a one entry line buffer [Wilson et al. 1996]. Consequently, many look-ups in D-cache reduce to incremental ones. This results in D-cache activity reduction and power savings. Our prefetcher requires both compiler and hardware support. In this paper, we provide implementation on the processor model close to ARM with small modification to the ISA. We tackle issues such as out-of-order commit, predication, and speculation through simple modifications to the processor pipeline on noncritical paths. Our goal in this work is to boost performance while maintaining/lowering power consumption. Our results show 12&percnt; speedup and slight power reduction. The runtime virtual space loss for stack and static data is about 11.8&percnt;.

#!Performing realistic simulations of Internet packet traffic on a national or global level is a daunting task from both the modeling and the computational perspective. We present the MIITS (Multi-scale Integrated Information and Telecommunications System) tool that implements a novel approach to network simulation and report first scaling results from a realistic Internet scenario. MIITS' end-to-end approach to network simulation relies on modules for (i) accurate network topology and capacity representation, (ii) realistic communication session generation based on the activities of an agent population that is statistically equivalent to the population in a large metropolitan area, (iii) the actual scalable packet-level network simulation that is based on distributed event-driven technology, and (iv) analysis of large amounts of simulation output data. We present a sample simulation of a Los Angeles network as an intermediate step toward the vision of national-level simulation.

That is, for determining a solution to the "convex feasibility" problem. We study the rate of convergence for the cyclic projections algorithm. The notion of angle between convex sets is defined, which generalizes the angle between linear subspaces. The rate of convergence results are described in terms of these angles.

#!In this paper, multiscale directional filter bank (MDFB) is investigated for texture characterization and retrieval. First, the problem of aliasing in decimated bandpass images on directional decomposition is addressed. MDFB is then designed to suppress the aliasing effect as well as to minimize the reduction in frequency resolution. Second, an entropy-based measure on energy signatures is proposed to classify structured and random textures. With the use of this measure for texture pre-classification, an optimized retrieval performance can be achieved by selecting the MDFB-based method for retrieving structured textures and a statistical or model-based method for retrieving random textures. In addition, a feature reduction scheme and a rotation-invariant conversion method are developed. The former is developed so as to find the most representative features while the latter is developed to provide a set of rotation-invariant features for texture characterization. Experimental works confirm that they are effective for texture retrieval.

#*Adaptive query processing: dealing with incomplete and uncertain statistics
#@David J. Dewitt
#t2006
#c
#index7125
#!The standard Database Management Systems (DBMS) query processing model picks a single non-adaptive plan and executes it to completion. The chosen plan aims to minimize running time by carefully optimizing the use of secondary storage, memory, and CPU. DBMS optimizers estimate plan costs by using statistics---information describing the datasets, the queries, and the system. When statistics needed to cost plans are not available in the database catalog, the optimizer estimates them by using heuristics, by assuming that some data distributions are uniform or independent, and by using a combination of other possibly estimated statistics or default values. These estimates may contain errors and these errors grow exponentially with the number of estimated statistics derived from other estimated statistics. This may lead to selecting a query plan that is sub-optimal by several orders of magnitude. Having more information in the catalog (e.g., histograms) reduces the problem but does not scale with the number of relations and attributes in the database. In addition, several hardware and software trends are making this hard problem harder. For example, the optimization space is increasing exponentially because there are more operators to consider, larger datasets to manage, and more complex queries to optimize. Thus, optimizers are increasingly more likely to select sub-optimal plans.In the general case, DBMS optimizers may have insufficient information to choose a single, good, non-adaptive query plan. Instead of focusing on providing more information to the optimizer, we propose several Adaptive Query Processing (AQP) techniques as alternatives or extensions to the non-adaptive architecture employed by today's commercial database systems. Our proposals are targeted to: (i) correct or avoid query processing problems due to the use of incorrect and partial information at optimization time and (ii) collect information not available at optimization time and dynamically determine and assign different plans for different subsets of the data. The work presented here complements, extends, or supersedes previous AQP proposals.

#!In this paper, we present a novel image representation that renders it possible to access natural scenes by local semantic description. Our work is motivated by the continuing effort in content-based image retrieval to extract and to model the semantic content of images. The basic idea of the semantic modeling is to classify local image regions into semantic concept classes such as water, rocks, or foliage. Images are represented through the frequency of occurrence of these local concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the image representation is well suited for modeling the semantic content of heterogenous scene categories, and thus for categorization and retrieval.The image representation also allows us to rank natural scenes according to their semantic similarity relative to certain scene categories. Based on human ranking data, we learn a perceptually plausible distance measure that leads to a high correlation between the human and the automatically obtained typicality ranking. This result is especially valuable for content-based image retrieval where the goal is to present retrieval results in descending semantic similarity from the query.

#!This paper presents a novel method for diagnosis of heart disease. The proposed method is based on a hybrid method that uses fuzzy weighted pre-processing and artificial immune recognition system (AIRS). Artificial immune recognition system has showed an effective performance on several problems such as machine learning benchmark problems and medical classification problems like breast cancer, diabetes, liver disorders classification. The robustness of the proposed method is examined using classification accuracy, k-fold cross-validation method and confusion matrix. The obtained classification accuracy is 96.30% and it is very promising compared to the previously reported classification techniques.

#!David Marr's <u>Vision</u> is jammed with information about what it means to see, both technically and philosophically; it lucidly reports the last ten years of research into the human visual system from the multi-disciplinary perspective of Marr and his colleagues. Workers in human vision tended to have either a neuro-physiological background (as Marr had), or a psychophysical one. In the early seventies Marr reached the conclusion that such disciplines helped to describe rather than explain the behaviour of neural cells or of subjects. He moved to the MIT artificial intelligence lab in 1973, in the hope that, by trying to build an artificial vision system, the fundamental engineering reasons for the structure of the human visual system could be discovered.

#!An intelligent monitoring and control system for parcel delivery service is described in this paper. To manage pick-up and delivery operations more effectively, geographical information system (GIS), global positioning system (GPS), and wireless communication technologies are applied to the system which consists of three subsystems, pick-up and delivery sequence planning system, pick-up and delivery monitoring system, and PDA execution system. Pick-up and delivery sequence planning system generates routes and schedules for pick-up and delivery using GIS and optimization techniques. Pick-up and delivery monitoring system monitors current positions of vehicles and actual pick-up and delivery results as compared with planned sequences, routes and visit times, while PDA execution system transmits information for vehicles positions and actual pick-up and delivery results using GPS and wireless communication technologies. The intelligent monitoring and control system is currently being used for the pick-up service in a local post office of Korea Post.

#!Object-oriented frameworks play an important role in different kinds of software, such as product-lines, middleware, GUI components, IDEs, etc. Over the past recent years, fundamentals of framework design stabilized around the adoption of design patterns. However, major difficulties concerning framework learning and usage are still evident, and constitute a burden for those who have to deal with it. This paper proposes an approach that aims to facilitate framework usage, based on the concept of specialization aspect. We show how framework hot-spots can be modularized in terms of specialization aspects, and how these can give support for specializing a framework in a step-wise way. The approach is conservative, in the sense that specialization aspects can be developed for an existing framework "as is". In order to support these claims, a case study has been carried out by applying the technique on the JHotDraw graphical framework.

#!Probably the most eventful occurrence at the recent Mathematical Programming Symposium at Stanford was Dr. Hugo Scolnik's presentation of his New Approach to Linear Programming. This approach rapidly became the subject of much discussion, and a somewhat hastily written version (and later an addendum) of the presentation was distributed in response to the general clamor (this material was reproduced in the last issue of this Newsletter). By the end of the symposium the odds seemed to have shifted to the viewpoint that Scolnik may indeed have a major new result.

#!We propose to extend the well-known MUSCL-Hancock scheme for Euler equations to the induction equation modeling the magnetic field evolution in kinematic dynamo problems. The scheme is based on an integral form of the underlying conservation law which, in our formulation, results in a "finite-surface" scheme for the induction equation. This naturally leads to the well-known "constrained transport" method, with additional continuity requirement on the magnetic field representation. The second ingredient in the MUSCL scheme is the predictor step that ensures second order accuracy both in space and time. We explore specific constraints that the mathematical properties of the induction equations place on this predictor step, showing that three possible variants can be considered. We show that the most aggressive formulations (referred to as C-MUSCL and U-MUSCL) reach the same level of accuracy as the other one (referred to as Runge-Kutta), at a lower computational cost. More interestingly, these two schemes are compatible with the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. It has been implemented in the AMR code RAMSES. It offers a novel and efficient implementation of a second order scheme for the induction equation. We have tested it by solving two kinematic dynamo problems in the low diffusion limit. The construction of this scheme for the induction equation constitutes a step towards solving the full MHD set of equations using an extension of our current methodology.

#!In this article we focus on approximation algorithms for facility location problems with subadditive costs. As examples of such problems, we present three facility location problems with stochastic demand and exponential servers, respectively inventory. We present a (1 + ε, 1)-reduction of the facility location problem with subadditive costs to the soft capacitated facility location problem, which implies the existence of a 2(1 + ε)-approximation algorithm. For a special subclass of subadditive functions, we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm by reduction to the linear cost facility location problem.

#!Reversible logic is motivated by low-power design, quantum circuits, and nanotechnology. We develop a compact representation of small reversible circuits to generate and store optimal circuits for all 40,320 three-input reversible functions, and millions of four-input circuits. This allows implementing a function optimally in constant time for use in the peephole optimization of larger circuits produced by existing techniques, and guarantees that every three-bit subcircuit is optimal. To generate subcircuits, we use a graph-based data structure and algorithms for circuit restructuring. Finally, we demonstrate a suboptimal circuit for which peephole optimization fails.

#!As cell phones have expanded their functionality with enhanced mobile technology, use of cell phones has become complex. Although usability of cell phones has been improved by featuring hierarchical menu systems, designing comprehensible navigation in the menu hierarchy is still a major challenge to cell phone user interface (UI) developers as more diverse users are adopting cell phones. To develop an easy-to-use cell phone UI, an effective usability evaluation method (UE) is essential. While various usability evaluation methods (UEM) have been developed, laboratory-based usability testing produces high-quality usability data from actual users. Yet, the effectiveness of such testing can vary dramatically depending on what data is collected and how the data are analyzed. To provide a practical guidance for the effective laboratory testing, we developed a systematic evaluation methodology for cell phone user interfaces (SEM-CPU). SEM-CPU is specifically designed to integrate five empirical methods (scenario-based task performance, questionnaires, post-task interview, user observation, and retrospective think aloud) into a laboratory-based test in order to evaluate cell phone UIs. By following SEM-CPU, usability engineers should be able to (1) conduct laboratory-based testing with multiple empirical methods in an efficient way, (2) collect diverse but useful data to measure necessary usability attributes, (3) identify determinants of usability problems, and (4) integrate all usability data to generate proper solutions for the problems. Detailed descriptions of SEM-CPU are presented along with a case study where SEM-CPU was applied to a comparative cell phone usability test.

#%113986
#!At the Eighth International Symposium on Mathematical Programming (August 1973 at Stanford), Hugo Scolnik suggested a line of reasoning leading to an algorithm which he thought might solve the linear programming problem in polynomial time. The algorithm which Scolnik contemplated would construct an optimal basis one column at a time, in such a way that once a column is selected to be in this basis, it need never be thrown out later; after t basic columns had been selected, the algorithm would first use two rejection criteria (a) and (b) to reduce the number of candidates for the (t+1)st column and would then use a selection criterion (c) to choose one of the remaining candidates.

As an application we give a representation of a restricted dual basis and define a class of quasi-interpolants.

#!Motivated by the studies in Gestalt principle, this paper describes a novel approach on the adaptive selection of visual features for trademark retrieval. We consider five kinds of visual saliencies: symmetry, continuity, proximity, parallelism and closure property. The first saliency is based on Zernike moments, while the others are modeled by geometric elements extracted illusively as a whole from a trademark. Given a query trademark, we adaptively determine the features appropriate for retrieval by investigating its visual saliencies. We show that in most cases, either geometric or symmetric features can give us good enough accuracy. To measure the similarity of geometric elements, we propose a maximum weighted bipartite graph (WBG) matching algorithm under transformation sets which is found to be both effective and efficient for retrieval.

#!Despite the recent appearance of self-organizing distributed systems for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, specific theoretical aspects of both their properties and the mechanisms used to establish those properties have been largely overlooked. This has left many researchers confused as to what constitutes a self-organizing distributed system and without a vocabulary with which to discuss aspects of these systems. This article introduces an agent-based model of self-organizing MANET and P2P systems and shows how it is realised in three existing network systems. The model is based on concepts such as partial views, evaluation functions, system utility, feedback and decay. We review the three network systems, AntHocNet, SAMPLE, and Freenet, and show how they can achieve high scalability, robustness and adaptability to unpredictable changes in their environment, by using self-organizing mechanisms similar to those found in nature. They are designed to improve their operation in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, enabling them to often demonstrate superior performance to state of the art distributed systems. This article is also addressed at researchers interested in gaining a general understanding of different mechanisms and properties of self-organization in distributed systems.

#!This paper describes a technique to recognize a Mesoamerican symbol whose shape is extremely variable. We extract symbols from a drawing and we encode them as discrete curves. We perform the recognition using a set of rules that define the correct symbol. One of the rules is the presence of a single symmetry axis. We describe a comparison metric between curves in order to search for symmetries. The other rules used for the recognition concern the morphology of the symbol. The proposed technique proves to be fast and efficient. We present recognition results obtained on various pre-hispanic images. The rule-based approach proposed and implemented here, appears suitable to detect polymorphic signs, a common feature of Mesoamerican symbols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of pattern recognition into the field of Mesoamerican iconography.

#!Like every other application in Microsoft Office suite, PowerPoint is loaded with features. So many, in fact, that even veterans don't know where to find them all. Microsoft solved this problem in PowerPoint 2007 by redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes features easy to locate and use. PowerPoint 2007 also boasts improved graphics, additional templates, the ability to save custom layouts, and improved collaboration through SharePoint. One thing Microsoft hasn't improved is its poor documentation. To learn the ins and outs of all the features in PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft merely offers online help. If you're familiar with previous versions of the program, you may be lost the first time you fire up the new PowerPoint; or you would be if it weren't for PowerPoint 2007: The Missing Manual. This new book, written specifically for this version of the software, not only offers the basics of how to create, save, set up, run, and print a basic bullets-and-background slideshow, but takes you into the world of multimedia, animation, and interactivity. You'll learn how to add pictures, sound, video, animated effects, and controls (buttons and links) to their slides, along with ways to pull text, spreadsheets, and animations created in other programs. You can also create your own reusable design templates and learn to automate repetitive tasks with macros. Learn how to take advantage of advanced functions (such as adding custom background images) that existed in previous PowerPoint versions, but were so cleverly hidden that few people ever found them.

#%269963

#!Currently, Profile Hidden Markov Models (Profile HMMs) are the methodology of choice for probabilistic protein family modeling. Unfortunately, despite substantial progress the general problem of remote homology analysis is still far from being solved. In this article we propose new approaches for robust protein family modeling by consequently exploiting general pattern recognition techniques. A new feature based representation of amino acid sequences serves as the basis for semi-continuous protein family HMMs. Due to this paradigm shift in processing biological sequences the complexity of family models can be reduced substantially resulting in less parameters which need to be trained. This is especially favorable when only little training data is available as in most current tasks of molecular biology research. In various experiments we prove the superior performance of advanced stochastic protein family modeling for remote homology analysis which is especially relevant for e.g. drug discovery applications.

#!Many stateful services use the replicated state machine approach for high availability. In this approach, a service runs on multiple machines to survive machine failures. This paper describes SMART, a new technique for changing the set of machines where such a service runs, i.e., migrating the service. SMART improves upon existing techniques in three important ways. First, SMART allows migrations that replace non-failed machines. Thus, SMART enables load balancing and lets an automated system replace failed machines. Such autonomic migration is an important step toward full autonomic operation, in which administrators play a minor role and need not be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Second, SMART can pipeline concurrent requests, a useful performance optimization. Third, prior published migration techniques are described in insufficient detail to admit implementation, whereas our description of SMART is complete. In addition to describing SMART, we also demonstrate its practicality by implementing it, evaluating our implementation's performance, and using it to build a consistent, replicated, migratable file system. Our experiments demonstrate the performance advantage of pipelining concurrent requests, and show that migration has only a minor and temporary effect on performance.

#!This brief report outlines some recent results of our research program involving applications of cybernetic concepts and artificial intelligence techniques to automation of business problem solving. Specifically, it reports an application of generalized perceptron-type pattern recognition techniques to (at least partial) automation of investment decision making. As man-machine systems, we have implemented investment decision systems programming both, stock market timing and investment selection. They were tested in actual investment analysis, and their performance was then gradually improved with the aid of machine learning algorithms. The experimental results indicate that with such techniques investment performance can be improved.

#!Building content-based search tools for feature-rich data has been a challenging problem because feature-rich data such as audio recordings, digital images, and sensor data are inherently noisy and high dimensional. Comparing noisy data requires comparisons based on similarity instead of exact matches, and thus searching for noisy data requires similarity search instead of exact search.The Ferret toolkit is designed to help system builders quickly construct content-based similarity search systems for feature-rich data types. The key component of the toolkit is a content-based similarity search engine for generic, multi-feature object representations. To solve the similarity search problem in high-dimensional spaces, we have developed approximation methods inspired by recent theoretical results on dimension reduction. The search engine constructs sketches from feature vectors as highly compact data structures for matching, filtering and ranking data objects. The toolkit also includes several other components to help system builders address search system infrastructure issues. We have implemented the toolkit and used it to successfully construct content-based similarity search systems for four data types: audio recordings, digital photos, 3D shape models and genomic microarray data.

#!Supply chain management (SCM) is an emerging field that has commanded attention and support from the industrial community. Demand forecast taking inventory into consideration is an important issue in SCM. There are many diverse inventory systems, in theory or practice, which are operated by entities (companies) in a supply chain. In order to increase supply chain effectiveness, minimize total cost, and reduce the bullwhip effect, integration and coordination of these different systems in the supply chain (SC) are required using information technology and effective communication. The paper develops a multi-agent system to simulate a supply chain, where agents operate these entities with different inventory systems. Agents are coordinated to control inventory and minimize the total cost of a SC by sharing information and forecasting knowledge. The demand is forecasted with a genetic algorithm (GA) and the ordering quantity is offered at each echelon incorporating the perspective of "systems thinking". By using this agent-based system, the results show that total cost decreases and the ordering variation curve becomes smooth.

#!Ranked lists of output trees from syntactic statistical NLP applications frequently contain multiple repeated entries. This redundancy leads to misrepresentation of tree weight and reduced information for debugging and tuning purposes. It is chiefly due to nondeterminism in the weighted automata that produce the results. We introduce an algorithm that determinizes such automata while preserving proper weights, returning the sum of the weight of all multiply derived trees. We also demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness on two large-scale tasks.

#!By analyzing the similarities between bit streams coming from a network of motion detectors, we can recover the network geometry and discover structure in the human behavior being observed. This means that a low-cost network of sensors can provide powerful contextual information to building systems: improving the efficiency of elevators, lighting, heating, and cooling; enhancing safety and security; and opening up new opportunities for human-centered information systems. This paper will show how signal similarity can be used to calibrate a sensor network to accuracies below the resolution of the individual sensors. This is done by analyzing the similarity structures in the unconstrained movement of people in the observed space. We will also present our efficient behavior-learning algorithm that yields 90% correct behavior-detection in data from a sensor network comprised of motion detectors by employing similarity-based clustering to automatically decompose complex activities into detectable sub-classes.

#!This research develops a data-integrated approach for constructing simulation models based on a real data set provided by Baylor Regional Medical Center (Baylor) in Grapevine, Texas. Tree-based models and kernel density estimation were utilized to extract important knowledge from the data for the simulation. Classification and Regression Tree model, a data mining tool for prediction and classification, was used to develop two tree structures: (a) a regression tree, from which the amount of time a nurse spends in a location is predicted based on factors, such as the primary diagnosis of a patient and the type of nurse; and (b) a classification tree, from which transition probabilities for nurse movements are determined. Kernel density estimation is used to estimate the continuous distribution for the amount of time a nurse spends in a location. Merits of using our approach for Baylor's nurse activity simulation are discussed.

#*Difference detection in LC-MS data for protein biomarker discovery
#@Jennifer Listgarten,Radford M. Neal,Sam T. Roweis,Peter Wong,Andrew Emili

#index7336
#!Motivation: There is a pressing need for improved proteomic screening methods allowing for earlier diagnosis of disease, systematic monitoring of physiological responses and the uncovering of fundamental mechanisms of drug action. The combined platform of LC-MS (Liquid-Chromatography-Mass-Spectrometry) has shown promise in moving toward a solution in these areas. In this paper we present atechnique for discovering differences in protein signal between two classes of samples of LC-MS serum proteomic data without use of tandem mass spectrometry, gels or labeling. This method works on data from a lower-precision MS instrument, the type routinely used by and available to the community at large today. We test our technique on a controlled (spike-in) but realistic (serum biomarker discovery) experiment which is therefore verifiable. We also develop a new method for helping to assess the difficulty of a given spike-in problem. Lastly, we show that the problem of class prediction, sometimes mistaken as a solution to biomarker discovery, is actually a much simpler problem. Results: Using precision--recall curves with experimentally extracted ground truth, we show that (1) our technique has good performance using seven replicates from each class, (2) performance degrades with decreasing number of replicates, (3) the signal that we are teasing out is not trivially available (i.e. the differences are not so large that the task is easy). Lastly, we easily obtain perfect classification results for data in which the problem of extracting differences does not produce absolutely perfect results. This emphasizes the different nature of the two problems and also their relative difficulties. Availability: Our data are publicly available as a benchmark for further studies of this nature at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jenn/LCMS Supplementary Information: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jennl/LCMS Contact: jenn@cs.toronto.edu

#!Workload generation is commonly employed for performance characterization, testing and benchmarking of computer systems and networks. Workload generation typically aims at simulating or emulating traffic generated by different types of applications, protocols and activities, such as web browsing, email, chat, as well as stream multimedia traffic. We present a Scalable WORkloaD generator (SWORD) that we have developed for the testing and benchmarking of high-volume data processing systems. The tool is not only scalable but is also flexible and extensible allowing the generation of workload of a variety of types of applications and of contents.

#!We present a new algorithm for solving two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programs (SMIPs) having discrete first-stage variables, and continuous or discrete second-stage variables. For a minimizing SMIP, the BEST algorithm (1) computes an upper Bound on the optimal objective value (typically a probabilistic bound), and identifies a deterministic lower-bounding function, (2) uses the bounds to Enumerate a set of first-stage solutions that contains an optimal solution with pre-specified confidence, (3) for each first-stage solution, Simulates second-stage operations by repeatedly sampling random parameters and solving the resulting model instances, and (4) applies statistical Tests (e.g., "screening procedures") to the simulated outcomes to identify a near-optimal first-stage solution with pre-specified confidence. We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on a stochastic facility-location problem.

#!Each group G of n × n permutation matrices has a corresponding permutation polytope, P(G) := conv(G) ⊂ Rn × n. We relate the structure of P(G) to the transitivity of G. In particular, we show that if G has t nontrivial orbits, then min{2t, ⌊n/2⌋} is a sharp upper bound on the diameter of the graph of P(G). We also show that P(G) achieves its maximal dimension of (n - 1)2 precisely when G is 2-transitive. We then extend the results of Pak [I. Pak, Four questions on Birkhoff polytope, Ann. Comb. 4 (1) (2000) 83-90] on mixing times for a random walk on P(G). Our work depends on a new result for permutation groups involving writing permutations as products of indecomposable permutations.

#!We describe a new procedure for verifying ACL2 properties about finite state machines (FSMs) using satisfiability (SAT) solving. We present an algorithm for converting ACL2 conjectures into conjunctive normal form (CNF), which we then output and check with an external satisfiability solver. The procedure is directly available as an ACL2 proof request. When the SAT tool is successful, a theorem is added to the ACL2 system database as a lemma for use in future proof attempts. When the SAT tool is unsuccessful, we use its output to construct a counter-example to the original ACL2 property.

#!Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a "simple" set of operations that allows you to more easily monitor and manage network devices like routers, switches, servers, printers, and more. The information you can monitor with SNMP is wide-ranging--from standard items, like the amount of traffic flowing into an interface, to far more esoteric items, like the air temperature inside a router. In spite of its name, though, SNMP is not especially simple to learn. O'Reilly has answered the call for help with a practical introduction that shows how to install, configure, and manage SNMP. Written for network and system administrators, the book introduces the basics of SNMP and then offers a technical background on how to use it effectively. Essential SNMP explores both commercial and open source packages, and elements like OIDs, MIBs, community strings, and traps are covered in depth. The book contains five new chapters and various updates throughout. Other new topics include:Expanded coverage of SNMPv1, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3Expanded coverage of SNMPcThe concepts behind network management and change managementRRDTool and CricketThe use of scripts for a variety of tasksHow Java can be used to create SNMP applicationsNet-SNMP's Perl moduleThe bulk of the book is devoted to discussing, with real examples, how to use SNMP for system and network administration tasks. Administrators will come away with ideas for writing scripts to help them manage their networks, create managed objects, and extend the operation of SNMP agents.Once demystified, SNMP is much more accessible. If you're looking for a way to more easily manage your network, look no further than Essential SNMP, 2nd Edition.

#%289711
#!This article presents a long&dash;term inter&dash;disciplinary research project situated at the intersection of the scientific disciplines of Musicology and Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to develop AI, and in particular machine learning and data mining, methods to study the complex phenomenon of expressive music performance. Formulating formal, quantitative models of expressive performance is one of the big open research problems in contemporary (empirical and cognitive) musicology. Our project develops a new direction in this field: we use inductive learning techniques to discover general and valid expression principles from (large amounts of) real performance data. The project is currently starting its third year and is planned to continue for at least four more years.In the following, we explain the basic notions of expressive music performance, and why this is such a central phenomenon in music. We present the general research framework of the project, and discuss the various challenges and research opportunities that emerge in this framework. We then briefly describe the current state of the project and list the main achievements made so far. In the rest of the paper, we discuss in more detail one particular data mining approach (including a new algorithm for learning characterisation rules) that we have developed recently. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm can discover very general and robust expression principles, some of which actually constitute novel discoveries from a musicological viewpoint.

#!Researchers who make theoretical advances also need some way to demonstrate that an advance really does have general, overall positive consequences for system performance. For this it is necessary to evaluate the system on a set of problems that is sufficiently large and diverse to be somehow representative of the intended application area as a whole. It is only a small step from system evaluation to a communal system competition. The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) has been run annually since 1996. Any competition is difficult to design and organize in the first instance, and to then run over the years. In order to obtain the full benefits of a competition, a thoroughly organized event, with an unambiguous and motivated design, is necessary. For some issues relevant to the CASC design, inevitable constraints have emerged. For other issues there have been several choices, and decisions have had to be made. This paper describes the evolution of CASC, paying particular attention to its design, design changes, and organization.

#!This paper provides a source level description of a compiled microprogramming language for the Microprogrammed Control Unit (MCU) of the Signal Processing Element (AN/UYK-17), currently under development at the Naval Research Laboratory. Its present form is strictly that of a "paper" language; current research at Brown is directed toward the problems encountered in optimizing microcode for this (horizontal) machine. The structure and syntax of PUMPKIN is closely related to that of LSD - a Language for Systems Development which has been implemented at Brown [BE71, BE72, MA74]. The level (power, expressibility, distance from hardware capabilities) of PUMPKIN provides some hope that we may be able to generate usable code for the MCU - no machine independence goals exist for PUMPKIN. Some aspects of the design philosophy behind the language are contained in the paper "Design Considerations for Microprogramming Languages" [LL74], to be published in the 1974 NCC Proceedings.

#index7426
#!This paper presents a transcoding method that dynamically adapts Web pages to various devices. The proposed method is based on a CC/PP profile that is a standard description of a device's context information. For a sophisticated transcoding, we define an annotation schema to describe an annotation that is meta information about original contents. Since a mobile device has a screen of limited size, a Web page might be split into many smaller pages. For an efficient navigation, the proposed method constructs a navigation map that represents the hierarchical relations among the split pages. Experimental results with various Web contents show that the proposed method has performed successfully in terms of users' convenience of navigation and the transcoding quality.

#!The tree representation of evolutionary relationship oversimplifies the view of the process of evolution as it cannot take into account the events such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization, homoplasy and genetic recombination. Several algorithms exist for constructing phylogenetic networks which result from events such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization and homoplasy. Very little work has been published on the algorithmic detail of phylogenetic networks with constrained recombination. The problem of minimizing the number of recombinations in a phylogenetic network, constructed using binary DNA sequences, is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a pattern recognition-based O(n^2) time approach for constructing the phylogenetic network, where n is the number of nodes or sequences in the input data. The network is constructed with the restriction that no two cycles in the network share a common node.

#!In this paper we propose an application-independent model for the definition of artificial institutions that can be used to define open multi-agent systems. Such a model of institutional reality makes us able also to define an objective and external semantics of a commitment-based Agent Communication Language (ACL). In particular we propose to regard an ACL as a set of conventions to act on a fragment of institutional reality, defined in the context of an artificial institution. Another contribution of the work presented in this paper is an operational definition of norms, a crucial component of artificial institutions. In fact in open systems interacting agents might not conform to the specifications. We regard norms as event-driven rules that when are fired by events happening in the system create or cancel a set of commitments. An interesting aspect of our proposal is that both the definition of the ACL and the definition of norms are based on the same notion of commitment. Therefore an agent capable of reasoning on commitments can reason on the semantics of communicative acts and on the system of norms.

#*A novel fuzzy classification entropy approach to image thresholding

#!In this paper, a novel fuzzy classification entropy approach to generic image thresholding is proposed. Under the assumption that the grayscale histogram of an image follows multimodal distribution, the fuzzy membership function is modified, and the fuzzy entropy is redefined, named fuzzy classification entropy (FCE), to indicate the fitness of the membership function to the actual histogram. The novel membership function and FCE consider not only inter-class distinctness, but also intra-class variety, which provides more accurate description of the histogram. We present bi-level and multi-level thresholding using FCE and conduct experiments on many grayscale images. The results show that the novel method can get moderate thresholds for most images, with better visual quality and less complexity than other fuzzy entropy based methods.

#!Basic protection schemes against Denial-of-Service (DoS) are based on a perimeter-based model, where attacks are dealt with after they occur. This is quite often too late to prevent damage or loss of resources and service. The focus of this paper is to investigate a distributed defense method that can neutralize the attack before it reaches the potential target in mass. In order to effectively implement this method, this paper proposes a progressive, globally deployable sentinel scheme for data sampling, packet inspection, and DoS attack detection and recovery. A simulation framework is developed to study the performance of the proposed scheme. The results show a significant improvement in how the network deals with DoS attacks, in comparison to local DoS detection and prevention schemes.

#!This paper presents new methods for automatic classification and retrieval of motion capture data facilitating the identification of logically related motions scattered in some database. As the main ingredient, we introduce the concept of motion templates (MTs), by which the essence of an entire class of logically related motions can be captured in an explicit and semantically interpretable matrix representation. The key property of MTs is that the variable aspects of a motion class can be automatically masked out in the comparison with unknown motion data. This facilitates robust and efficient motion retrieval even in the presence of large spatio-temporal variations. Furthermore, we describe how to learn an MT for a specific motion class from a given set of training motions. In our extensive experiments, which are based on several hours of motion data, MTs proved to be a powerful concept for motion annotation and retrieval, yielding accurate results even for highly variable motion classes such as cartwheels, lying down, or throwing motions.

#*Hierarchical parameter setting for hybrid grid generation based on the STEP model representation
#@Aristotelis N. Athanasiadis,Herman Deconinck
#t2004
#cApplied Numerical Mathematics
#index7474
#!In this work we present a method for defining parameters for hybrid grid generation in complex geometries. The method is hierarchical and uses the topological information present in the domain model. The latter is based on the STEP ISO boundary representation allowing compatibility with all major CAD systems. The parameter definition permits a detailed control of the grid spacing in the semi-structured part of the grid, while ensuring a smooth spacing variation across the model. Furthermore, arbitrary grid sources can be defined to control the grid size in the unstructured part of the grid if the default size variation is not satisfactory. Finally, an algorithm has been developed to automatically derive many of the grid generation parameters, creating high quality surface grids for complex models with minimum user input.

#!Sophisticated design aids are available to help automate microprogram development both for large, complex computers and for microprocessor-based systems. These aids include procedures for source code verification, object code generation, micro-program simulation, and interactive debugging. For various reasons, such aids are generally not well-developed for micro-programmable minicomputers. This paper describes a microprogramming laboratory developed for the Interdata 85 minicomputer which uses both the minicomputer itself as well as the time-sharing and batch facilities of a large computer center. Experience with the laboratory has shown that the facility for interacting with a microprogram is as important as the availability of complete diagnostic information. The argument is made that design automation aids for microprogramming minicomputers could be produced most efficiently from standardized assembly and simulation programs.

#!This paper describes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) designed to optimise the Assembly Sequence Planning Problem (ASPP), an extremely diverse, large scale and highly constrained combinatorial problem. The modelling of the ASPP problem, Which has to be able to encode any industrial-size product with realistic constraints, and the GA have been designed to accommodate any type of assembly plan and component. A number of specific modelling issues necessary for understanding the manner in which the algorithm works and how it relates to real-life problems, are succinctly presented, as they have to be taken into account/adapted/solved prior to Solving and Optimising (S/O) the problem. The GA has a classical structure but modified genetic operators, to avoid the combinatorial explosion. It works only with feasible assembly sequences and has the ability to search the entire solution space of full-scale, unabridged problems of industrial size. A case study illustrates the application of the proposed GA for a 25-components product.

#!Healthcare organizations are often organized in a modular, loosely coupled fashion where separate and semi-autonomous work units specialize in different areas of care delivery. This partitioning allows each unit to adapt to emerging practice standards in its area of expertise and to adjust to its local work environment. However, organizational loose coupling can limit the flow of information within organizations and can make it difficult to coordinate services when patients' care is dependent on professionals from more than one unit. Groupware systems have the potential to improve coordination and information access in healthcare organizations. However, modularity and loose coupling make it difficult to introduce new systems when they span more than one unit, since authority is not always centralized and since perceptions and frames of reference on new deployments differ across units. In this paper, we define a groupware deployment framework for loosely coupled healthcare organizations that has two parts: a set of deployment challenges and a set of deployment strategies. The deployment challenges include: difficulties centralizing deployments, perceptions of inequity, role conflicts, and problems achieving critical mass. The deployment strategies outline a preliminary set of approaches for addressing the difficulties of deploying CSCW systems in loosely coupled healthcare organizations. We illustrate the framework by presenting a case study of a groupware deployment in a home care setting.

#!ACL2 is used to systematically study domains whose elements can be "uniquely" factored into products of "irreducible" elements. The best known examples of such domains are the positive integers, which can be factored into products of primes, and univariate polynomials with rational coefficients, which can be factored into products of irreducible polynomials. There are many other such domains.Euclidean domains are an algebraic abstraction, of both the positive integers and the rational polynomials, in which the usual proofs of unique factorization, for both the integers and the polynomials, can be generalized.

#!Third party logistics service providers (3PLs) are playing an increasing role in the management of supply chains. Especially in warehousing and transportation services, a number of clients expect for 3PLs to improve lead times, fill rates, inventory levels, etc. Hence, these 3PLs are under pressure to meet various clients' service requirements in a dynamic and uncertain business environment. As a result, 3PLs should maintain an efficient distribution system of high performance competitive advantages. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization/simulation approach to design a distribution network for 3PLs in consideration of the performance of the warehouses. The optimization model uses a genetic algorithm to determine dynamic distribution network structures. Subsequently, the simulation model is applied to capture the uncertainty in clients' demands, order-picking time, and travel time for the capacity plans of the warehouses based on service time. The approach is applied to an example problem for examining its validity.

#*Demand assigned capacity management (DACM) in IP over optical (IPO) networks
#@Daniel O. Awduche,Bijan Jabbari

#index7546
#!The demand assigned capacity management (DACM) problem in IP over optical (IPO) network aims at devising efficient bandwidth replenishment schedules from the optical domain conditioned upon traffic evolution processes in the IP domain. A replenishment schedule specifies the location, sizing, and sequencing of link capacity expansions to support the growth of Internet traffic demand in the IP network subject to economic considerations. A major distinction in the approach presented in this paper is the focus of attention on the economics of "excess bandwidth" in the IP domain, which can be viewed as an inventory system that is endowed with fixed and variable costs and depletes with increase in IP traffic demand requiring replenishment from the optical domain. We develop mathematical models to address the DACM problem in IPO networks based on a class of inventory management replenishment methods. We apply the technique to IPO networks that implement capacity adaptive routing in the IP domain and networks without capacity adaptive routing. We analyze the performance characteristics under both scenarios, in terms of minimizing cumulative replenishment cost over an interval of time. For the non-capacity adaptive routing scenario, we consider a shortest path approach in the IP domain, specifically OSPF. For the capacity adaptive scenario, we use an online constraint-based routing scheme. This study represents an application of integrated traffic engineering which concerns collaborative decision making targeted towards network performance improvement that takes into consideration traffic demands, control capabilities, and network assets at different levels in the network hierarchy.

#!Financial statements are very vital to the organization and all stake holders, including government, creditors, investors, auditors and the general public. Over the years, there has been emphasis placed on evaluating the quantitative aspects of financial statements and accounting information. Less emphasis has been placed on the qualitative components. Often times the use of common sense, rule of thumb, intuition and experience apply in assessing the qualitative value of financial information. This study attempts to identify a comprehensive set of variables for the comparative evaluation of the qualitative aspects of firms' financial statements. The Analytical Hierarchy Process [AHP] is applied in the modeling of the financial statement evaluation process. The results of the study show that the AHP provides a stepwise refinement of the results of the initial evaluation process to attain some level of optimality in the decision process regarding the evaluation of financial information of corporate organizations.

#!While a variety of optimization formulations of production planning problems have been proposed over the last fifty years, the majority of these are based on simple models of capacity that fail to reflect the nonlinear relationship between workload and lead times induced by the queuing behavior of capacitated production resources. We use system dynamics simulations of a simple capacitated production system to examine the performance of several different capacity models that yield load-dependent lead times, and relate these models to those used in system dynamics models of production systems.

#!We present a closed-loop architecture and protocols for rapid dynamic spreading gain adaptation and fast feedback between a transmitter and a receiver communicating with each other in CDMA networks. These protocols and architecture do not require the transfer of an explicit control message indicating the change of CDMA spreading gain from transmitter to receiver. Also, with these protocols, the transmitter can change the spreading gain symbol-by-symbol as opposed to frame-by-frame, and feedback information (e.g., the fast-varying channel condition) can be exchanged almost as frequently as the symbol rate. Thus, adaptation to the time-varying channel conditions of wireless networks and/or to the rate variation of traffic can be much faster than is possible with the existing frame-by-frame approach.

#!"Almost Runge-Kutta", or ARK, methods form a sub-class of general linear methods, with properties very close to those of traditional Runge-Kutta methods. They have previously been applied only to non-stiff problems. In this paper we explore their possible generalisation to diagonally implicit methods, for the solution of stiff problems. A characteristic feature of these new methods is that, although some of the data computed in a step has order limited to 2, this inaccuracy does not effect the order of the subsequent steps. Consequences of these assumptions are explored and this leads on to the derivation of some new methods of orders three and four. Preliminary numerical experiments are promising for some of these methods.

#!In the past few years, some nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) or nonlinear manifold learning methods have aroused a great deal of interest in the machine learning community. These methods are promising in that they can automatically discover the low-dimensional nonlinear manifold in a high-dimensional data space and then embed the data points into a low-dimensional embedding space, using tractable linear algebraic techniques that are easy to implement and are not prone to local minima. Despite their appealing properties, these NLDR methods are not robust against outliers in the data, yet so far very little has been done to address the robustness problem. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of an NLDR method called locally linear embedding (LLE). Based on robust estimation techniques, we propose an approach to make LLE more robust. We refer to this approach as robust locally linear embedding (RLLE). We also present several specific methods for realizing this general RLLE approach. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that RLLE is very robust against outliers.

#!Plumber is a specialized shape classification method for detecting tubular features of 3D objects represented by a triangle mesh. The Plumber algorithm segments a surface into connected components that are either body parts or elongated features, that is, handle-like and protrusion-like features, together with their concave counterparts, i.e. narrow tunnels and wells. The segmentation can be done at single or multi-scale, and produces a shape graph which codes how the tubular components are attached to the main body parts. Moreover, each tubular feature is represented by its skeletal line and an average cross-section radius.

#!In this paper we describe a new approach for increasing the reliability of ubiquitous software systems. This is achieved by executing tests at run-time. The individual software components are consequently accompanied by executable tests. We augment this well-known built-in test (BIT) paradigm by combining it with resource-awareness. Starting from the constraints for such resource-aware tests (RATs) we derive their design and describe a number of strategies for executing such tests under resource constraints as well as the necessary middleware. Our approach is especially beneficial to ubiquitous software systems due to their dynamic nature - which prevents a static verification of their reliability - and their inherent resource limitations.

#!A wide variety of video content-news programs, documentaries, sports shows, movies, and the like-is broadcast today in digital format to interactive TVs. Unlike a conventional TV, an interactive TV allows the viewer to navigate back and forth in time through the available content. Surprisingly, few studies have addressed the problems that arise when navigation along the time dimension becomes possible. The aim of this study was to develop navigation aids for interactive TVs that are theoretically grounded and empirically verified. Toward this end, we first designed two new navigation aids based on episodic indexing theory (EIT): a recency-frame and a short-reminder. Second, we built an interactive TV simulator (ITS) to test the new navigation aids in a controlled experiment. Finally, we devised several measures appropriate for evaluating navigation aids for interactive TV in addition to traditional usability measures. Subsequently, employing the interactive TV simulator and the newly devised measures, we conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the two proposed navigation aids. We found that both navigation aids enhanced the quality of the viewer's experience. The paper concludes with a discussion of the study's limitations and implications.

#!Historically, inductive machine learning has focused on non&dash;incremental learning tasks, i.e., where the training set can be constructed a priori and learning stops once this set has been duly processed. There are, however, a number of areas, such as agents, where learning tasks are incremental. This paper defines the notion of incrementality for learning tasks and algorithms. It then provides some motivation for incremental learning and argues in favour of the design of incremental learning algorithms for solving incremental learning tasks. A number of issues raised by such systems are outlined and the incremental learner ILA is used for illustration.

#!Information fusion is a powerful approach to increasing the accuracy of biometric authentication systems, and is currently an active area of research. The majority of studies focus on combining the results from multiple verification systems at the match score level using either a classification or combination scheme. However, there are advantages to performing the fusion at an earlier stage of processing. Fingerprint registration involves finding the translation and rotation parameters that align two fingerprints; a challenging problem that can be approached in a number of ways. The fusion of fingerprint alignment algorithms is introduced in the form of dynamic registration selection. A Bayesian statistical framework is used to select the most probable alignment produced by competing algorithms. The results of the proposed technique are tested on multiple FVC 2002 databases, and are shown to outperform methods based on match score combination.

#!New solutions have been proposed to address problems with the Internet's interdomain routing protocol, BGP. Before their deployment, validation of incremental performance gains and backwards compatibility is necessary. For this task, the Internet's large size and complexity make all techniques but simulation infeasible. When performing large-scale network simulations, memory requirements for routing table storage can become a limiting factor. This work uses model reduction to mitigate this problem, with reduction defined in terms of the number of routers. Our framework uses path properties specific to interdomain routing to define the conditions of a path-preserving scale-down transformation. For implementation, vertex contraction and deletion were used to remove routers from a preliminary nominal network model. Vertex contraction was seen to violate the conditions of the transformation. A small subgraph from a measured topology is used for experimental validation. Routing tables are compared to show equivalence under the model reduction.

#!Complex software intensive simulation systems must respond to changing technology, environments, and requirements. Hence, dynamic extensibility and adaptability is a significant concern in an application domain. However, existing interoperability and composability solutions are limited in dealing with (1) dynamically evolving content needs of existing simulations and (2) run-time inclusion of new components into a simulation system. Simulations that are dynamically extensible, while being interoperable require principled designs that facilitate engineering extensibility, interoperability, and composability in the first place. We propose and examine the utility of a strategy based on an agent-mediated meta-simulation architecture.

This -00 book covers DB2 V8 while the -01 version covers DB2 V9, so we are making both books available. This IBM Redbook describes the benefits of DB2® V8 for SAP Business Information Warehouse. It lists best practices and provides performance and tuning recommendations for SAP Business Information Warehouse. In today's fast-moving business environment, there is a need for more and better business information. Data warehousing and business intelligence (BI) systems deliver that information. This imposes new requirements to manage, control, and use this data for business purposes. SAP Business Information Warehouse is the central reporting tool for almost all SAP business solutions. It is based on building blocks called InfoObjects that contain data about customers, sales, and business information. InfoObjects include InfoSources, ODS objects, and InfoCubes. The business intelligence solution from IBM and SAP can help you aggregate and leverage this information, giving you a system-wide view of your business data and delivering it across your enterprise to support sound business decisions. However, this structure can lead to slow performance if the system is not set up and managed according to good database principles. This IBM Redbook describes best practices for this product on a zSeries® platform, and provides performance and tuning recommendations for loading and querying data. It also addresses general system administration and troubleshooting. The audience for this redbook includes SAP and DB2 administrators. Knowledge of these products and of the WhitepaperRedpaper z/OS® environment is assumed. This IBM Redbook is designed to aid the reader based on specific needs. After describing the product and summarizing its advantages on the zSeries platform, we list best practices for the PSA, Infocube, ODS, and DB2 components. We give tips on how to gain efficiency when using compression and indexing. We also include a troubleshooting chapter that describes what to do when best practices do not address a problem.

#!Protocols enable unambiguous, smooth interactions among agents. Commitments among agents are a powerful means of developing protocols. Commitments enable flexible execution of protocols and help agents reason about protocols and plan their actions accordingly, while at the same time providing a basis for compliance checking. Multiagent systems based on commitments can conveniently and effectively model business interactions because the autonomy and heterogeneity of agents mirrors real-world businesses. Such modeling, however, requires multiagent systems to host a rich variety of protocols that can capture the needs of different applications. We show how a commitment-based semantics provides a basis for refining and aggregating protocols. We propose an approach for designing commitment protocols wherein traditional software engineering notions such as refinement and aggregation are extended to apply to protocols. We present an algebra of protocols that can be used to compose protocols by refining and merging existing ones, and does this at a level of abstraction high enough to be useful for real-world applications.

#!Modelling of the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks typically proceeds by solving ordinary differential equations or stochastic simulation via the Gillespie algorithm. More recently, computational methods such as process algebra techniques have been successfully applied to the analysis of signalling pathways. One advantage of these is that they enable automatic verification of the models, via model checking, against qualitative and quantitative temporal logic specifications, for example, "what is the probability that the protein eventually degrades?". Such verification is exhaustive, that is, the analysis is carried out over all paths, producing exact quantitative measures. In this paper, we give an overview of the simulation, verification and differential equation approaches to modelling biochemical reaction networks. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the respective methods, using as an illustration a fragment of the FGF signalling pathway.

#!A new model for evolving evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is proposed in this paper. The model is based on the multi expression programming (MEP) technique. Each MEP chromosome encodes an evolutionary pattern which is repeatedly used for generating the individuals of a new generation. The evolved pattern is embedded into a standard evolutionary scheme which is used for solving a particular problem. Several evolutionary algorithms for function optimization are evolved by using the considered model. The evolved evolutionary algorithms are compared with a human-designed genetic algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the evolved evolutionary algorithms can compete with standard approaches for several well-known benchmarking problems.

#!Real-time desktop computer graphics systems have historically been based on empirical lighting models, such as the Phong lighting model, designed to be perceptually appropriate, but computationally efficient. New hardware developments since early 2003 have resulted in an affordable fourth generation graphical processing unit technology. This technology is allowing desktop computer graphics systems, like NVIDIA's GeForce&reg; series, to implement more and more complex computer graphics algorithms, and lighting models for real-time applications. This paper describes an innovative "physically based" spectral lighting, material and camera model that is based on radiometry theory and is an expansion of the historical fixed pipeline graphics system. There are two render target modes of which Direct mode is aimed at high spectral resolution solids rendering and buffered mode at including transparencies.

#!This paper describes an approach to modeling and analysis of complex time-dependent systems specified by modular Time Petri Nets (TPNs). The approach is supported by a Java tool TPN Designer- which permits visual modeling, debugging and discrete-event simulation. The tool is characterized by its modularity and hierarchical constructs, a scripting language for controlling model configuration and scalability, and a monitoring and watching sub system for collecting simulation output. TPN Designer permits also to split a model into LP/subnets for distributed simulation. The tool is able to translate a flattened TPN model into Uppaal/Timed Automata for model checking. The paper demonstrates the practical use of the approach through modeling and validation of a system based on the alternating bit protocol.

#!Genetic algorithms are commonly used metaheuristics for global optimization, but there has been very little research done on the generation of their initial population. In this paper, we look for an answer to the question whether the initial population plays a role in the performance of genetic algorithms and if so, how it should be generated. We show with a simple example that initial populations may have an effect on the best objective function value found for several generations. Traditionally, initial populations are generated using pseudo random numbers, but there are many alternative ways. We study the properties of different point generators using four main criteria: the uniform coverage and the genetic diversity of the points as well as the speed and the usability of the generator. We use the point generators to generate initial populations for a genetic algorithm and study what effects the uniform coverage and the genetic diversity have on the convergence and on the final objective function values. For our tests, we have selected one pseudo and one quasi random sequence generator and two spatial point processes: simple sequential inhibition process and nonaligned systematic sampling. In numerical experiments, we solve a set of 52 continuous test functions from 16 different function families, and analyze and discuss the results.

#!Creativity is an innate human impulse, many people believe, something we're born with but too often “grow out of” as adult lives make more and more demands. Fortunately for us, the creative drive continues to run strong in legendary designer Brendan Dawes. Habitually alert to the happy accident, and possessed of highly eclectic interests and a quirky wit, he has happened into his perfect career. Around this habitï¾call it a philosophyï¾of asking, “Why does this have to be this way? What if . . .,” Dawes has built magneticNorth, an acclaimed Web and interaction design practice, based in Manchester, U.K. In this unique book, Dawes invites readers inside a series of his personal projects to get a view of his process--his creative seeing, making, and playing. He encourages designers to look beyond the normal tools of their trade to find inspiration in the most unlikely of places: tubs of children's clay, anonymous notes, household plumbing fixtures, jazz music, snow globes, fast-food take-out bags, airport departure gates, and more. Brilliant, original, and always grounded in the needs of users, Dawes shares both the techniques he has created and the key lessons he has learned in design: why comfort is the enemy of creativity; how mistakes can be celebrated instead of feared, and how to strip design to its purest and most powerful forms. Known worldwide for his entertaining and inspirational presentations, Dawes now brings profound insights to a book that is certain to become a classic inspiration for designers of every type. Brendan Dawes is Creative Director of the interactive design group magneticNorth, based in Manchester, UK. His clients include the Walt Disney Co., the BBC, Kellogg's, and Coca-Cola. Dawes' work has been featured in numerous journals, including idN, Creative Review, MacUser, Computer Arts, Create, The Guardian, and Communications Arts. He was also featured in New Masters of Flash and other books, and is the author of Flash ActionScript for Designers: Dra,g Slide, Fade.

#!Point matching is the task of finding correspondences between two sets of points such that the two sets of points are aligned with each other. Pure point matching uses only the location of the points to constrain the problem. This is a problem with broad practical applications, but it has only been well studied when the geometric transformation relating the two point sets is of a relatively low order. Here we present a heuristic local search algorithm that can find correspondences between point sets in two dimensions that are related by a projective transform. Point matching is a harder problem when spurious points appear in the sets to be matched. We present a heuristic algorithm which minimizes the effects of spurious points.

#t2006
#cACM SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communications Review
#index7745
#!Network Capacity, which is limited by interference between simultaneous transmissions of neighboring links, is a fundamental performance metric for wireless ad hoc networks. Ref. [1] showed that the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks with omnidirectional antennae does not scale well as the node density increases. Other related work ([2], [3], [4], etc.) demonstrated that the network capacity scales better with the use of directional antennae. Most previous investigations, however, were based on simplified but unrealizable models of antenna patterns. So far, there has not been a general framework for the analysis of network capacity when directional antennae of realizable generic patterns are used. Also, few papers have derived explicitly the impact of nulls and null-width in antenna pattern on network scalability. Specifically, the scale law of network capacity with general directional antennae has not yet been investigated. This paper addresses these issues. We study arbitrary and random networks (corresponding to the best case and random case respectively), where nodes with smart antennae are assumed to be located in a planar disk without mobility. We also point out how to generalize the result to that of generic directional antenna pattern. To conserve space here, we defer detailed analysis of the impact of null-width to the full paper.

Previously, we have shown such a behavior for some of the SPEC2000 integer benchmarks using HP ATOM instrumentation tools. However, this required extensive analysis by hand, and assumptions regarding side-effects caused by functions. In this paper, we modified a well-known architecture simulator, SimpleScalar, to analyze multiple benchmarks to investigate the function reuse behavior.

#!Conceptual modeling is a critical step that directly affects the quality and efficiency of simulation projects. However current technology can hardly support the process and most practice demonstrated an ad hoc and inefficient approach. Automation can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of conceptual simulation modeling. However, there are a number of issues must be addressed, including the formalization of model concepts, representation of modeling knowledge, and interaction between user and computer system. This paper presents a discussion of these issues based on the research by the authors, and propose suggestions for the design and development of a robust computerized modeling environment that aims to improve conceptual simulation modeling process.

#!Simulation-based design optimization is a key technology in many industrial sectors. Recent developments in software technology have opened a novel range of possibilities in this area. It has now become possible to involve multiple organizations in the simulation of a candidate design, by composing their respective simulation modules on the Internet. Thus, it is possible to deploy an inter-organizational design optimization system, which may be particularly appealing because modern engineering products are assembled out of smaller blocks developed by different organizations. In this paper we explore some of the fundamental performancerelated issues involved in such a novel scenario, by analyzing a variety of options: centralized control vs. distributed control; generation of new candidate designs one at a time or in batches; communication and computation performed serially or with time overlap. Our analysis provides useful insights into the numerous trade-offs involved in the implementation of inter-organizational design optimization.

#!In order to animate complex fluid motion, computer animators have to rely on simulation systems that automatically generate the dynamics in a physics based manner. We focus in this paper on the phenomenon of boiling, which, due to its complex formulation and physics, has seen very little work done in the graphics field. We propose a new Eulerian method that couples gas and liquid with variable temperature and with a mass transfer mechanism, and we present its application to simulating boiling phenomena. Our philosophy is using physics based models to obtain visually rich animations that mirror their real life counterparts, including phenomena of increased circulation in the mass of liquid, roiling boil, nucleation seeding on solid boundaries.

#!The beauty of a home network is that it can make life so easy--what could be better than sharing an Internet connection so that everyone can be online at the same time? With home networking you can move files from one computer to another, share resources, print to a single printer or multiple printers from any computer in the house, and IM the kids when they're holed up in their rooms. And the downside? Anyone who's ever had to troubleshoot a network glitch doesn't need to ask that question. The simple words, "Why can't I print? Why can't I get to the Internet? Why does my computer say 'Access Denied' today, when it worked fine yesterday?" are enough to send the home network administrator running for cover. And the concept of "network security" can keep the soundest sleeper tossing and turning all night. Currently, more than 8 million homes in the US have installed a network of some kind, and within five years, that number is expected to jump to 37 million. This speaks to the availability of easy-to-install home networking products. Unfortunately, there's also a glut of potential headaches that can occur after installation (and during, sometimes) with no warning label on the box saying, "This product sure to cause annoyances." But help is here. Home Networking Annoyances will ease the headaches and annoyances of anyone who runs a home network. This book tackles all the common annoyances associated with running your network--whether it's wired or wireless, or a combination thereof. Its friendly, off-the-cuff approach will put you in a position of power over those home networking glitches, including file sharing, printing, cabling, security, and much more. You'll find dozens of on-target tips, workarounds, and fixes that will help you improve your home networking experience in every way possible. Whether you're a mainstream business user or a home user with newly installed network hardware, you've probably had your patience tested by frustrating network maintenance issues. Take a stand against annoyances now: just as the bestselling PC Annoyances brought peace and happiness to PC users everywhere, Home Networking Annoyances is your ticket to serenity.

#!We present results from an empirical user-study with ten users which investigates if information from a user's environment helps a user interface to personalize itself to individual users to better meet usability goals and improve user-experience. In our research we use a microphone and a web-camera to collect this information (user-context) from the vicinity of a subject's desktop computer. Sycophant, our context-aware calendaring application and research test-bed uses machine learning techniques to successfully predict a user-preferred alarm type. Discounting user identity and motion information significantly degrades Sycophant's performance on the alarm prediction task. Our user study emphasizes the need for user-context for personalizable user interfaces which can better meet effectiveness and utility usability goals. Results from our study further demonstrate that contextual information helps adaptive interfaces to improve user-experience.

#!Using concepts arising in control variates, we propose estimating gradients using Monte Carlo data from a single design point. Our goal is to create a statistically efficient estimator that is easy to implement, with no analysis within the simulation oracle and no unknown algorithm parameters. We compare a simple version of the proposed method to finite differences and simultaneous perturbation, assuming first and second-order linear logic models and response surfaces. Results of the analysis indicate that the proposed gradient estimator is unbiased with variance that is inversely related to the variance of the assumed input model. Compared to the only existing single design-point method, the proposed gradient estimator is advantageous in that its variance is not dependent on the magnitude of the response surface at the design point of interest and also decreases as the simulation run length increases.

#!a lattice Boltzmann model for simulating multiphase flows with large density ratios is described in this paper. The method is easily implemented. It does not require solving the Poisson equation and does not involve the complex treatments of derivative terms. The interface capturing equation is recovered without any additional terms as compared to other methods [M.R. Swift, W.R. Osborn, J.M. Yeomans, Lattice Boltzmann simulation of liquid-gas and binary fluid systems, Phys. Rev. E 54 (1996) 5041-5052; T. Inamuro, T. Ogata, S. Tajima, N. Konishi, A lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible two-phase flows with large density differences, J. Comput. Phys. 198 (2004) 628-644; T. Lee, C.-L. Lin, A stable discretization of the lattice Boltzmann equation for simulation of incompressible two-phase flows at high density ratio, J. Comput. Phys. 206 (2005) 16-47]. Besides, it requires less discrete velocities. As a result, its efficiency could be greatly improved, especially in 3D applications. It is validated by several cases: a bubble in a stationary flow and the capillary wave. The numerical surface tension obtained from the Laplace law and the interface profile agrees very well with the respective analytical solution. The method is further verified by its application to capillary wave and the bubble rising under buoyancy with comparison to other methods. All the numerical experiments show that the present approach can be used to model multiphase flows with large density ratios.

#!We propose the extended Bézier spiral in this paper. The spiral is useful for both design purposes and improved aesthetics. This is because the spiral is one of the Bézier curves, which play an important role in interactive curve design, and because the assessment of the curve is based on the human reception of the curve. For the latter purpose we utilize the logarithmic distribution graph that quantifies the designers' preferences. This paper contributes the unification of the two different curve design objectives (the interactive operation and so called "eye pleasing" result generation); which have been independently investigated so far.

#!Stalking is a pattern of behavior over time in which a stalker seeks to gain access to, or control over, an unwilling victim. Such actions range from the benign to the malicious and may cause emotional distress or harm to the victim. With the widespread adoption of new technologies, new forums of Internet-mediated discourse now exist which offer stalkers unprecedented scope to locate and exert influence over victims. Cyberstalking, the convergence of stalking and cyberspace, has created new challenges for the prevention, detection, and prosecution of this new phenomenon as the traditional methods of detection by witnesses and enforcement through physical restraining orders often are inadequate.In this paper we suggest a cryptographic approach for tracking cyberstalkers. We first define the threat model in terms of the profile of a cyberstalker, as well as legal and law enforcement constraints. We then describe a monitoring system that addresses the basic admissibility requirements of our threat model, by capturing and verifying circumstantial evidence for use in cyberstalking investigations.

#!A previous study on the benefits of monolithically stacked 3D-FPGA has estimated a 3.2x improvement in logic density, a 1.7x improvement in delay, and a 1.7x improvement in dynamic power consumption over a baseline 2D-FPGA with no change in architecture. This paper describes a new routing fabric and shows that a 3D-FPGA using this fabric can achieve a 3.3x improvement in logic density, a 2.35x improvement in delay, and a 2.82x improvement in dynamic power consumption over the same baseline 2D-FPGA. The additional improvements in delay and power consumption are achieved by reducing net loading in several ways: (i) Only Single and Double interconnect segments are used. This reduces the total interconnect length used to implement each net. (ii) The routing fabric is hierarchical. Each logic block's inputs and outputs connect first to local segments. These segments can be then programmably connected to local segments in neighboring routing blocks via programmable buffers and/or to interconnect segments in routing channels via muxes with buffered outputs. (iii) Interconnect segments can be directly connected to form longer segments using programmable buffers without going through routing blocks. (iv) The routing block provides switching capability beyond that of a conventional switch box. A 3D-FPGA using this new routing fabric can be realized by stacking two configuration memory layers and a switch layer on top of a standard CMOS layer with a total of 12 metal layers interspersed between them. A CAD flow based on VPR with appropriate modifications to the routing graph generation and routing algorithm is developed and used in the performance analysis.

#!Degradation of the visual system can lead to a dramatic reduction of mobility by limiting a person to his sense of touch and hearing. This paper presents the development of an obstacle detection system for visually impaired people. While moving in his environment the user is alerted to close obstacles in range. The system we propose detects an obstacle surrounding the user by using a multi-sonar system and sending appropriate vibrotactile feedback. The system aims at increasing the mobility of visually impaired people by offering new sensing abilities.

#!We propose new schemes for integrating the stochastic differential equations of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) in simulations of dilute polymer solutions. The hybrid DPD models consist of hard potentials that describe the microscopic dynamics of polymers and soft potentials that describe the mesoscopic dynamics of the solvent. In particular, we develop extensions to the velocity-Verlet and Lowe's approaches - two representative DPD time-integrators - following a subcycling procedure whereby the solvent is advanced with a timestep much larger than the one employed in the polymer time-integration. The introduction of relaxation parameters allows optimization studies for accuracy while maintaining the low computational complexity of standard DPD algorithms. We demonstrate through equilibrium simulations that a 10-fold gain in efficiency can be obtained with the time-staggered algorithms without loss of accuracy compared to the non-staggered schemes. We then apply the new approach to investigate the scaling response of polymers in equilibrium as well as the dynamics of λ-phage DNA molecules subjected to shear.

#!Enterprise integration for identity management Complete architecture and component discussion Tivoli Access Manager integration Identity Management is the concept of providing a unifying interface to manage all aspects related to individuals and their interactions with the business. It is the process that enables business initiatives by efficiently managing the user life cycle (including identity/resource provisioning for people (users)), and by integrating it into the required business processes. Identity Management encompasses all the data and processes related to the representation of an individual involved in electronic transactions. This IBM Redbook provides an approach for designing an Identity Management solution with the IBM Tivoli Identity Manager Version 4.4. Starting from the high-level, organizational viewpoint, we show how to define user registration and maintenance processes using the Self Registration and Self Care Interfaces as well as the Delegated Administration capabilities. Using the Integrated Workflow, we automate the submission/approval processes for Identity Management requests, and with the Automated User Provisioning, we will take workflow output and automatically implement the administrative requests on the environment with no administrative intervention. This redbook is a valuable resource for security administrators and architects who wish to understand and implement a centralized identity management and security infrastructure.

#!Power consumption in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has become an important issue as the FPGA market has grown to include mobile platforms. In this work we present a power-aware logic optimization tool that is specialized to facilitate subsequent power-aware technology mapping. Our synthesis framework uses binary decision diagram (BDD) based collapsing and decomposition techniques in conjunction with signal switching estimates to achieve power-efficient circuit networks. The results of synthesis and subsequent power-aware technology mapping are evaluated using two distinct physical design platforms: academic VPR and Altera Quartus II. Our approach achieves an average energy reduction of 13% for Altera Cyclone II devices versus synthesis with SIS-based algebraic optimization at the cost of 11% average circuit performance if performance-optimal technology mapping is performed after synthesis. If technology mapping is tuned to achieve the same average delay for both SIS and BDD-based flows, a 3% average energy reduction is achieved by our new synthesis approach.

#!Planning plays an important role in precast production management. In practice, however, this work is primarily carried out on a rule-of-thumb basis. A specialized planning model based on simulation technique and genetic algorithm (GA) is presented in this paper for make-to-order precast production. A novel priority rule, the critical precast component (CP) rule, is established for mold considerations during simulation, and a bi-directional simulation is adopted to reduce excessive overtime and precast stock. On this basis, three simulation approaches are designed using different simulation heuristics and directions. To test the validity of the proposed model with different approaches, a planning experiment is carried out. By comparison, it is clear that the Simulation-GA based model using CP rule and bi-directional simulation can generate a satisfying resource plan and production schedule.

We present the UCPCD process and its background, and a selection of interactive theater tools that can be applied to UCPCD. Through a case study we introduce a practical implementation of these tools to UCPCD. The paper concludes by suggesting guidelines for using drama and dramaturgy in concept design activities. The key finding is that drama methods deepen the designers' involvement in the process and improve understanding of the user communities' behavior.

#!Custom-tailored products are defined as products having various sizes and shapes tailored to meet the customer's different tastes or needs. Thus fabrication of custom-tailored products inherently involves inefficiency. To minimize this inefficiency, a new paradigm is proposed in this work. In this paradigm, different parts are grouped into several groups according to their sizes and shapes. For grouping the different parts, similarity measurement algorithm is used. Similarity comparison starts with the determination of the closest pose between two shapes in consideration. The closest pose is derived by comparing the ray distances while one shape is virtually rotated with respect to the other. Shape similarity value and overall similarity value calculated from ray distances are also used for grouping. A prototype system based on the proposed methodology has been implemented and applied to the grouping and machining of the shoe lasts of various shapes and sizes.

Industry efforts to achieve convergence have generated a need for increased levels of traffic differentiation. An array of QoS requirements need to be met to support distinct applications (e.g. voice, video, and data) and multiple network services (e.g. IP, Ethernet, ATM) on a single converged, multiservice network. Therefore, QoS has become an integral part of an multiservice, converged network and service implementation. QoS for IP/MPLS Networks offers network architects and engineers a single source of information for the design, deployment, and implementation of QoS-enabled services on an MPLS network using Cisco IOS. Readers will gain knowledge of the technology behind MPLS QoS and related technologies and will learn the different design options available to build a multiservice MPLS network. The book covers in detail the behavior and configuration of the rich MPLS QoS functionality in Cisco IOS. It is a solid reference of working configuration examples, but does not intend to be a command reference on the subject. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

#!In manufacturing cells layout design with a unidirectional flow system, the accurate distance between two workcells can be uncovered with both the determination of IO port locations after the layout design of the cell with its orientation and the unidirectional flowpath layout design. This paper presents the method to obtain a global solution for manufacturing workcells and unidirectional flowpath layout design (ICFLD) with consideration of IO ports of workcells. The flow distance between two workcells is calculated from output port of one workcell to input port of the other workcell through the unidirectional flowpath layout. A zero-one integer programming model is developed for the ICFLD problem. And a heuristic algorithm for the ICFLD problem is developed by decomposing the ICFLD problem into two subproblems and iteratively and alternately solving the decomposed subproblems. Computational experiments are performed and its results are analyzed.

#!The United States Army's One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF) Objective System (OOS) is the next generation of Army high resolution combat models. Its development has leveraged the ever-increasing computing power available today to represent highly complex battlefield phenomena, particularly human behavior. In the fall of 2005, the Product Manager (PM) OneSAF asked us to conduct a verification of the orderable, composite behavior models within OOS. As a result, we developed and executed a unique process to verify those behaviors under tight resource constraints. Our methodology and test designs allowed us to evaluate the behaviors thoroughly with a minimum number of scenarios. Based upon our work, we were able to verify a number of composite behaviors and to provide valuable feedback to the PM OneSAF. In this paper, we provide an overview of the problem, a description of the methodology we developed, and a summary of our challenges and results.

#index7894
#!Management information accessible via SNMP is organized in the Management Information Base (MIB). Many management applications are based on management information within an MIB table. The management information useful for management applications may be located in some rows of an MIB table. Owing to the limitation of current SNMP GetNext and GetBulk services, it is usually inevitable to retrieve all the rows of an MIB table even if some of them are needed. As the size of the MIB table grows, the object retrieval will incur considerable bandwidth and latency. Without loss of the simplicity of SNMP, we propose a novel SNMP service, called GetRows, to provide the capability of object selection via SNMP. Using GetRows, a management application can specify criteria for evaluating rows of an MIB table. Only the object instances in the rows selected by the criteria will be retrieved. Thus, less bandwidth and latency can be achieved by using the proposed GetRows service.

#!This paper presents the Diagnosis Frontend of dlv, which is a knowledge representation system under development at the Technische Universit&auml;t Wien. The kernel language of the system is an extension of disjunctive logic programming (DLP) by integrity constraints&semi; it offers frontends to several advanced knowledge representation formalisms. The formal model of diagnosis employed in the frontend includes both abductive diagnosis (over DLP theories) and consistency&dash;based diagnosis. For each of the two diagnosis modalities, generic diagnoses, single error diagnoses, and subset minimal diagnoses are considered. We illustrate the use of the frontend by showing the dlv encodings of several diagnosis problems. Thereafter, we discuss implementation issues. Diagnostic reasoning is implemented on the dlv engine through suitable translations of diagnostic problems into disjunctive logic programs, such that their stable models correspond to diagnoses. For the six kinds of diagnostic reasoning problems emerging from above, such reductions are provided.

#!Data exchange between CAD systems is an extremely important solid modeling concept, fundamental both for the theory of the field and for its practical applications. The two main data exchange (DE) paradigms are geometric and parametric DE. Geometric DE is the ordinary method, in which the boundary representation of the object is exchanged. Parametric (or feature-based) DE is a novel method where, given a parametric history (feature) graph in a source system, the goal is to construct a graph in the target system that results in similar geometry while preserving as much parametric information as possible. Each method has its uses and associated problems.In this paper, we introduce Geometry Per Feature (GPF), a method for integration of parametric and geometric data exchange at the single part (object) level. Features can be exchanged either parametrically or geometrically, according to user guidelines and system constraints. At the target system, the resulting model is represented using a history tree, regardless of the amount of original parametric features that have been rewritten as geometric ones. Using this method we maximize the exchange of overall parametric data and overcome one of the main stumbling blocks for feature-based data exchange.

#!Join Point Designation Diagrams (JPDDs) permit developers to design aspect-oriented software on an abstract level. Consequently, JPDDs permit developers to communicate their software design independent of the programming language in use. However, developer face two problems. First, they need to understand the semantics of JPDDs in addition to their programming language. Second, after designing aspects using JPDDs, they need to decide how to map them into their programming language. A tool-supported translation of JPDDs into a known aspect-oriented language obviously would ease both problems. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to determine what a "good" JPDD translation looks like, i.e. it is necessary to have a number of principles that determine the characteristics of a "good" translation. This paper describes a tool-supported translation of JPDDs to aspect-oriented languages. Principles for translating JPDDs are described and a concrete mapping to the aspect-oriented language AspectJ is explained.

#!Very large textures are prohibitive for most interactive terrain rendering due to the use of excessive resources. Alternatively, tiled textures can be linearly blended to produce interesting transitions between predefined textures. However, these transitions seldom work well when the texture frequency content is not high. This paper introduces blend maps, a technique used to enhance the blending of textures so that features of the underlying texture are maintained or emphasised. The resulting texture appears more realistic in many cases, and adds to the perceived detail of the terrain. Blend maps are constructed by identifying important features in a texture. These features are often highlighted under certain lighting conditions. The blend maps are created manually, but some automation is possible. The importance is then used to control a blending operation in such a way that features can be preserved. The proposed algorithm is simple enough to allow realtime rendering on modern graphics hardware.

#@Rui Ishiyama,Masahiko Hamanaka,Shizuo Sakamoto

#cSystems and Computers in Japan
#index7940
#!This paper proposes a method in which an appearance model is constructed from 3D facial shape data that can describe the image variation due to the arbitrariness of the pose and the variation of the illumination, after which recognition is performed by fitting the model to facial images when the illumination conditions and the precise pose are unknown. The appearance model in the proposed method is constructed as follows. The illumination basis for an image of an arbitrary pose is derived from the geodesic illumination basis describing the brightness on the 3D object surface depending on the illumination variations, and an image with the same illumination condition is reproduced as the target image for the unknown illumination conditions. By optimizing the pose to minimize the reproduction error, model fitting with high accuracy is realized even if the exact pose is unknown. By experiment, the number of illumination samples needed in the calculation of the geodesic illumination basis is evaluated and it is verified that the proposed appearance model can describe arbitrary illumination variations in images with various poses. The robustness of the proposed pose optimization method against initial pose estimate is also evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a recognition experiment using 14,000 facial images taken in various situations, including extreme illumination variations such as backlighting, for a wide range of poses from frontal to 45&deg; upward and 60&deg; sidewise. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The results have been tested through dealing with classical fractal figures, pit morphology of moon surface and practical corroded samples etc. to show that this new method is computationally simple, convenient and accurate. More specially, D"2"d and D"3"d have definite corrosion expressions, which respectively denote the fractal dimensions for pit diameter distribution and pit depth distribution on real corroded surface.

#!For numerous problems in science and engineering a refined modeling approach leads to initial-boundary value problems for partial differential-algebraic equations (PDAEs). The paper investigates linear PDAEs from the point of view of weakly differentiable in space solutions. The appropriate treatment of boundary conditions is obtained by the requirement that the spatial differential operator has to satisfy a Gårding-type inequality in suitable function spaces. Based on this, an index concept extending the classical perturbation index is introduced.

#@Kung Han Yang,Yue-Cune Chang

#index7962
#!Longitudinal study has become one of the most commonly adopted designs in medical research. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method and/or mixed effects models are employed very often in causal inferences. The related model diagnostic procedures are not yet fully formalized, and perhaps never will be. The potential causes of major problems are the high variety of the dependence within subjects and/or the number of repeated measurements. A single testing procedure, e.g., run test, is not possible to resolve all model diagnostics problems in longitudinal data analysis. Multiple quantitative indexes for model diagnostics are needed to take into account this variety. We propose eight testing procedures for randomness accompanied with some conventional and/or non-conventional plots to remedy model diagnostics in longitudinal data analysis. The proposed issue in this paper is well illustrated with four clinical studies in Taiwan.

#!This paper presents the design of a generic HyperTransport (HT) core. It is specially optimized to achieve a very low latency. The core has been verified in system using the rapid prototyping methodology with FPGAs. This exhaustive verification and the generic design allows the mapping to both ASICs and FPGAs. The implementation described in this paper supports a link width of 16bit, as is used in Opteron based systems. On a Xilinx Virtex4FX60, the core supports a link frequency of 400MHz DDR and offers a maximum bidirectional bandwidth of 3.6 GB/s. The in-system verification has been performed using a custom FPGA board that has been plugged into a HyperTransport Extension Connector (HTX) of a standard Opteron based mainboard. HTX slots in Opteron based mainboards allow a very high-bandwidth, low latency communication, as the HTX device is directly connected to one of the Hyper-Transport links of the processor. HyperTransport is a packet-based interconnect technology for low-latency, high-bandwidth point-to-point connections. The HT core in combination with the HTX board is an ideal base for prototyping systems and FPGA coprocessors. The HT core is available as open source.

#!Clustering for the analysis of the genes organizes the patterns into groups by the similarity of the dataset and has been used for identifying the functions of the genes in the cluster and analyzing the functions of unknown genes. Since the genes usually belong to multiple functional families, fuzzy clustering methods are more appropriate than the conventional hard clustering methods which assign a sample to only one group. In this paper, a Bayesian-like validation method selecting a fuzzy partition is proposed to evaluate the fuzzy partitions effectively. The theoretical interpretation of the obtained memberships is beyond the scope of this paper, and an empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted by comparing to the four representative conventional fuzzy cluster validity measures in four well-known datasets. Analysis of yeast cell-cycle data follows to evaluate the proposed method.

#!Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) mitigate the risks of a service-provision scenario by associating financial penalties with aberrant service behaviour. SLAs are useless if their provisions can be unilaterally ignored by a party without incurring any liability. To avoid this, it is necessary to ensure that each party's conformance to its obligations can be monitored by the other parties. We introduce a technique for analysing systems of SLAs to determine the degree of monitorability possible. We apply this technique to identify the most monitorable system of SLAs including timeliness constraints for a three-role Application-Service Provision (ASP) scenario. The system contains SLAs that are at best mutually monitorable, implying the requirement for reconciliation of monitoring data between the parties, and hence the need to constrain the parties to report honestly while accommodating unavoidable measurement error. We describe the design of a fair constraint on the precision and accuracy of reported measurements, and its approximate monitorability using a statistical hypothesis test.

#!We propose a solution to a new problem in animation research: how to use human motion capture data to create character motion with detailed hand gesticulation without the need for the simultaneous capture of hands and the full-body. Occlusion and a difference in scale make it difficult to capture both the detail of the hand movement and unrestricted full-body motion at the same time. With our method, the two can be captured separately and spliced together seamlessly with little or no user input required. The algorithm relies on a novel distance metric derived from research on gestures and uses a two-pass dynamic time warping algorithm to find correspondence between the hand and full-body motions. In addition, we provide a method for supplying user input, useful to animators who want more control over the integrated animation. We show the power of our technique with a variety of common and highly specialized gesticulation examples.

#!Generally speaking, wafer fabrication factories define the photolithography area as the dispatching center of the entire factory. To establish a set of operative dispatching rules in the photolithography area while taking into consideration the rework of defective products would assist in coordinating and balancing the workload of the entire production line. Furthermore, it would help to enhance both the productivity and efficiency of the wafer fabrication, reduce the on-line WIP stock, shorten the production cycle time, and satisfy the requirements of customers regarding production due time and product quality. This research uses on-line rework as the basis for bringing the factor of reworking of a batch process into the dispatching rule for measurement. It then develops the dispatching rule (Rw-DR) which includes the rework strategy. In addition, this research focuses on the batch with high finished proportion in the photolithography area for finding a way to complete the manufacturing procedure faster, lighten the machine workload of the waiting line, and at the same time increase the output quantity.

#*Edge Field Analysis
#@Mitsuharu Matsumoto,Shuji Hashimoto
#t2007
#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index8007
#!In vector analysis, it is important to classify three flow primitives as translation, rotation and divergence. These three primitives can be detected utilizing line integral and surface integral according to the knowledge of vector analysis. In this paper, we introduce a method for extracting these three primitives utilizing edges in an image based on vector analysis, namely edge field analysis. The edge has the information of inclination. However, the edge has no information of the direction unlike vector. Hence, line integral and surface integral can not be directly applied to detect these three primitives utilizing edges. We firstly formulate the problem and describe the algorithm for detecting the three primitives in vector analysis. We then propose an algorithm for estimating three primitives regarding edge image as pseudo-vector field. For illustration, we apply edge field analysis to quasi-motion extraction and feature extraction. We also show the experimental results in terms of estimating the center of the flowers, the cell body of neuron, the eye of the storm, the center of the explosion and so on.

#%621033
#!In this paper, we develop failure-resilient techniques for monitoring link delays and faults in a Service Provider or Enterprise IP network. Our two-phased approach attempts to minimize both the monitoring infrastructure costs as well as the additional traffic due to probe messages. In the first phase, we compute the locations of a minimal set of monitoring stations such that all network links are covered, even in the presence of several link failures. Subsequently, in the second phase, we compute a minimal set of probe messages that are transmitted by the stations to measure link delays and isolate network faults. We show that both the station selection problem as well as the probe assignment problem are NP-hard. We then propose greedy approximation algorithms that achieve a logarithmic approximation factor for the station selection problem and a constant factor for the probe assignment problem. These approximation ratios are provably very close to the best possible bounds for any algorithm.

#!We address the problems of noise and huge data sizes in microarray images. First, we propose a mixture model for describing the statistical and structural properties of microarray images. Then, based on the microarray image model, we present methods for denoising and for compressing microarray images. The denoising method is based on a variant of the translation-invariant wavelet transform. The compression method introduces the notion of approximate contexts (rather than traditional exact contexts) in modeling the symbol probabilities in a microarray image. This inexact context modeling approach is important in dealing with the noisy nature of microarray images. Using the proposed denoising and compression methods, we describe a near-lossless compression scheme suitable for microarray images. Results on both denoising and compression are included, which show the performance of the proposed methods. Further experiments using the results of the proposed near-lossless compression scheme in gene clustering using cell-cycle microarray data for S. cerevisiae showed a general improvement in the clustering performance, when compared with using the original data. This provides an indirect validation of the effectiveness of the proposed denoising method.

#!Let Λ = |Se|/|Se+Sh|, where Sh and Se are independently distributed as Wishart distributions Wp (q, Σ) and Wp (n, Σ), respectively. Then Λ has Wilks' lambda distribution Λp,q,n which appears as the distributions of various multivariate likelihood ratio tests. This paper is concerned with theoretical accuracy for asymptotic expansions of the distribution of T =-n log Λ. We derive error bounds for the approximations. It is necessary to underline that our error bounds are given in explicit and computable forms.

#!Designing and Building Enterprise DMZs covers a sorely needed area in critical business infrastructure: the Demilitarized Zone. DMZs play a crucial role in any network consisting of a Hosted Internet Web Server, internal servers which need to be segregated, External to Internal DNS Server, and an E-mail SMTP Relay Agent. This book covers what an administrator needs to plan out and integrate a DMZ into a network for small, medium, and Enterprise networks. The primary role of a DMZ is to mitigate risks associated with offering services to untrusted clients. A DMZ accomplishes this by providing network-level protection for a hosting environment, as well as segregating public hosting facilities from the private network infrastructure. This small but very important segment of the network is the section exposed to the public Internet and is the most difficult area on the network to create, and maintain both from an Engineering standpoint and a security standpoint. In this book (the only one of its kind) readers will learn how to make DMZs utilizing the IT world's best of breed software and hardware products from Microsoft, Sun, Cisco, Nokia, and Check Point.

#!We consider the problem of document binarization as a pre-processing step for optical character recognition (OCR) for the purpose of keyword search of historical printed documents. A number of promising techniques from the literature for binarization, pre-filtering, and post-binarization denoising were implemented along with newly developed methods for binarization: an error diffusion binarization, a multiresolutional version of Otsu's binarization, and denoising by despeckling. The OCR in the ABBYY FineReader 7.1 SDK is used as a black box metric to compare methods. Results for 12 pages from six newspapers of differing quality show that performance varies widely by image, but that the classic Otsu method and Otsu-based methods perform best on average.

#!Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called k-anonymity has gained popularity. In a k-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k &minus; 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes. In this article, we show using two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called &ell;-diversity that can defend against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for &ell;-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that &ell;-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.

#!Emerging Web services, such as email, photo sharing, and web site archives, must preserve large volumes of quickly accessible data indefinitely into the future. The costs of doing so often determine whether the service is economically viable. We make the case that these applications' demands on large scale storage systems over long time horizons require us to reevaluate traditional system designs. We examine threats to long-lived data from an end-to-end perspective, taking into account not just hardware and software faults but also faults due to humans and organizations. We present a simple model of long-term storage failures that helps us reason about various strategies for addressing some of these threats. Using this model we show that the most important strategies for increasing the reliability of long-term storage are detecting latent faults quickly, automating fault repair to make it cheaper and faster, and increasing the independence of data replicas.

#!The development of common and reasonable criteria for evaluating and comparing the performance of segmentation algorithms has always been a concern for researchers in the area. As it is discussed in the paper, some of the measures proposed are not adequate for general images (i.e. images of any sort of scene, without any assumption about the features of the scene objects or the illumination distribution) because they assume a certain distribution of pixel gray-level or colour values for the interior of the regions. This paper reviews performance measures not performing such an assumption and proposes a set of new performance measures in the same line, called the percentage of correctly grouped pixels (CG), the percentage of over-segmentation (OS) and the percentage of under-segmentation (US). Apart from accounting for misclassified pixels, the proposed set of new measures are intended to compute the level of fragmentation of reference regions into output regions and vice versa. A comparison involving similar measures is provided at the end of the paper.

#!The fingerprint matching using the original FingerCode generation has proved its effectiveness but it suffers from some limitations such as the reference point localization and the recourse to the relative fingerprint pre-alignment stage. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid fingerprint matching technique based on minutiae texture maps according to their orientations. Therefore, rather than exploiting the eight fixed directions of Gabor filters for all original fingerprint images filtering process, we construct absolute images starting from the minutiae localizations and orientations to generate our weighting oriented Minutiae Codes. The extracted features are invariant to translation and rotation, which allows us avoiding the fingerprint pair relative alignment stage. Results are presented demonstrating significant improvements in fingerprint matching accuracy through public fingerprint databases.

#*Volume fusion: a unified framework for multi-scale dynamic and heterogeneous scenes
#@Duoduo Liao,Shiaofen Fang
#t2006
#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index8115
#!This work presents a novel unified solution --- a volume fusion framework for 3D modeling, interaction, and visualization applications with complex volumetric scenes composed of any type of conventional and unconventional object representations. The process of volume fusion includes scene expression and scene evaluation. A volume scene evaluation based on slice sweeping approach is employed to provide a general computational framework that extracts volumetric information of the scene expression and then fuse them by specified fusion functions. The key issues of volume fusion are scene tree design and fusion function design. Through the unified framework, different tree structures and fusion functions may result in different outputs (i.e., applications) after scene evaluation. Two case studies, volume modeling and volumetric collision detection, using volume fusion framework will be discussed in detail, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility and generality of our volume fusion algorithms for 3D interactive volume applications.

#!In a field study to explore influences on data warehouse refresh policies, we interviewed data warehouse administrators from 13 organizations about data warehouse details and organizational background. The dominant refresh strategy reported was daily refresh during nonbusiness hours with some deviations due to operational decision making and data source availability. As a result of the study, we developed a framework consisting of short-term and long-term influences of refresh policies along with traditional information system success variables influenced by refresh policies. The framework suggests the need for research about process design, data timeliness valuation, and optimal refresh policy design.

#!To maximize the cost efficiency in constructing the sports facilities for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, we applied the state-of-the-art construction operations simulation modeling to plan the operations of installing the steel structure, find the proper installation sequence and formulate the assembling area use schedule. The SDESA platform resulting from in-house research was utilized as the simulation tool for evaluating how the construction time for the steel structure of the "bird's nest" (the main stadium) would change subject to different steel installation sequences combined with varied schedules for assembling area use. The simulation outputs and the process animation -obtained from SDESA- not only validated the SDESA model, but also convinced the site management of the effectiveness of SDESA modeling and aided the site engineers in designing the optimum construction method.

#*Structure quality in deep X-ray lithography applying commercial polyimide-based masks

#cMicrosystem Technologies
#index8129
#!The structure quality of deep X-ray lithography components strongly depends on the quality of the applied X-ray mask. In this article we compare the results obtained with two different mask types. Sophisticated working masks generated by e-beam lithography, soft X-ray lithography and electroplating of gold absorbers on a titanium mask membrane have been fabricated at the Institute for Microstructure Technology, Research Center, Karlsruhe (FZK/IMT), Germany. Prototype masks generated by e-beam lithography, optical lithography and electroplating of gold absorbers on a polyimide mask membrane have been fabricated by Optnics Precision, Japan, with the aim to offer commercially available low cost masks. Both mask types were applied to pattern PMMA resist layers of 300&#x2013;750&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m thickness at the 2.5&#x00a0;GeV electron storage ring ANKA, Germany, using comparable process parameters. FZK/IMT masks provide microstructures with significantly better structure quality. The layout area, however, is currently limited to 12&#x00a0;cm2, and the Ti mask membrane tends to lead to a slight resist surface attack, such as rounding of the resist edges. Optnics masks provide microstructures with reduced structure quality due to sidewall striations (sidewall roughness up to 2&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m) and thermal distortions (of up to 3&#x2013;5&#x00a0;&#x03bc;m) which limit the potential scope of applications. They could nevertheless potentially be applied as low quality, low cost X-ray masks. High resolution and high accuracy applications, however, require more sophisticated but also more expensive masks, like the Ti-masks from FZK/IMT.

#!In this paper, we present a system for the automatic detection and tracking of metallic objects concealed on moving people in sequences of millimetre-wave images, which can penetrate clothing, plastics and fabrics. The subjects are required to enter one at a time and turn round slowly to ensure complete coverage for the scan. The system employs two distinct stages: detection and tracking. In this paper a single detector, for metallic objects, is presented which utilises a statistical model also developed in this paper. Target tracking is performed using a particle filter. Results are presented on real millimetre-wave image test sequences and indicate an excellent rate of success for threat identification. Encouraging results for target tracking are also reported.

#!This paper presents a kernel smoothing method for multinomial regression. A class of estimators of the regression functions is constructed by minimizing a localized power-divergence measure. These estimators include the bandwidth and a single parameter originating in the power-divergence measure as smoothing parameters. An asymptotic theory for the estimators is developed and the bias-adjusted estimators are obtained. A data-based algorithm for selecting the smoothing parameters is also proposed. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm works efficiently.

#!Microsoft Word has grown considerably in power, sophistication and capability over the past decade, but one thing that hasn't changed since the early '90s is its user interface. The simple toolbar in version 2.0 has been packed with so many features since then that few users know where to find them all. Consequently, more and more people are looking for "insider" tips that will allow them to use these advanced and often hidden features. Microsoft has addressed this problem in Word 2007 by radically redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes every feature easy to locate and use. Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as scant as ever, so even though you will be able to find advanced features, you might not know what to do with them. Word 2007: The Missing Manual, written specifically for this version of the software, explains basics like how to create documents, enter and edit text, format, print, and fax. You will will also learn how to create sophisticated page layouts, insert forms and tables, use graphics, and create book-length documents with outlines and Master Documents. Coverage also includes how to share documents with other people and programs, create web pages, automate documents with fields, and automate tasks with macros and the Visual Basic scripting language. This book shows you how to do it all.

It continues the book's tradition of introducing astoundingly effective, previously unknown methodsï¾ of image enhancement. The original photographs found in the book come from a variety of professional sources, and all correction exercises are on the included CD. Professional Photoshop has changed radically from edition to edition, and this time is no exception-with almost 90 percent new content and completely overhauled coverage of curves, channel blending, and sharpening.Professional Photoshop offers a full explanation of: How curves bring out detail in the most important areas of the imagenï¾ A comprehensive strategy for blending channels to create deeper, stronger images The strengths and weaknesses of CMYK, LAB, and RGB, and when to use each one The first detailed look at the Shadow/Highlight command-and even more sophis-ticated ways to enhance contrast in the lightest and darkest parts of the imagen Sharpening strategies, in three full chapters, including the innovative hiraloam method (High Radius, Low Amount). Plus, a fiendishly effective method of merging hiraloam and conventional unsharp masking The realities-and the politics-of preparing files for commercial offset printing and how to deal with colors that are out of the press's gamut What Camera Raw and similar acquisition modules can offer Typical problems of digital captures that were not found in the age of film- and how to correct for them

#!As more and more human motion data are becoming widely used to animate computer graphics figures in many applications, the growing need for compact storage and fast transmission makes it imperative to compress motion data. We propose a data-driven method for efficient compression of human motion sequences by exploiting both spatial and temporal coherences of the data. We first segment a motion sequence into subsequences such that the poses within a subsequence lie near a low dimensional linear space. We then compress each segment using principal component analysis. Our method achieves further compression by storing only the key frames' projections to the principal component space and interpolating the other frames in-between via spline functions. The experimental results show that our method can achieve significant compression rate with low reconstruction errors.

#!A square is a string that can be divided into two identical substrings. The problem of square detection has found applications in areas such as bioinformatics and data compression. There are many offline algorithms for the problem. In this paper, we give the first online algorithm for deciding whether a string contains a square. Our algorithm runs in total O(h log2 h) time where h is the length of the longest prefix of the input string that does not contain a square.

#!In this paper, a completely automatic face recognition system is presented. The method works on color images: after having localized the face and the facial features, it determines 24 facial fiducial points, and characterizes them applying a bank of Gabor filters which extract the peculiar texture around them (jets). Recognition is realized measuring the similarity between the different jets. The system is inspired by the elastic bunch graph method, while it does no assumption on the scale, pose, and the background. Comparison with standard algorithms is presented and discussed.

#!There have been many research works on epidemic spreading using mathematical or simulation methods. However, to make it practical as a decision support tool for the policy maker, it needs to be combined with business operation of epidemic control. Thus, an alert and response framework covering outbreak detection, policy analysis, and policy execution is proposed in this work. Key technologies for such a framework at the modeling, analysis, and data collection aspects are discussed. Sensitivity analysis is proposed for model verification and confidence analysis. Critical point identification is another important topic for control policy making by network topology analysis. The importance and feasibility of these technologies are illustrated by the experiment on Beijing SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) data in 2003.

#!In support of Canadian Forces (CF) transformation, a study was conducted to explore strategic lift movement strategies within the context of rapid deployability to counter asymmetric threats in failed or failing states around the globe. This study makes extensive use of two interconnected models. An aircraft loading optimization model using a combination of simulated annealing and genetic algorithm techniques with a novel convex hull based measure of effectiveness was developed to derive near-optimal loading plans across a fleet of transportation assets. The output from the loading model was then fed into a Monte Carlo simulation framework developed to allow for study of the effectiveness of a variety of strategic lift options. Analysis indicates that pre-positioning of equipment at various international locations and increased use of C-17 aircraft for airlift---where economically viable---could be potential strategies for improvement of the CF strategic lift.

#!This paper presents a novel face detection method by applying discriminating feature analysis (DFA) and support vector machine (SVM). The novelty of our DFA-SVM method comes from the integration of DFA, face class modeling, and SVM for face detection. First, DFA derives a discriminating feature vector by combining the input image, its 1-D Haar wavelet representation, and its amplitude projections. While the Haar wavelets produce an effective representation for object detection, the amplitude projections capture the vertical symmetric distributions and the horizontal characteristics of human face images. Second, face class modeling estimates the probability density function of the face class and defines a distribution-based measure for face and nonface classification. The distribution-based measure thus separates the input patterns into three classes: the face class (patterns close to the face class), the nonface class (patterns far away from the face class), and the undecided class (patterns neither close to nor far away from the face class). Finally, SVM together with the distribution-based measure classifies the patterns in the undecided class into either the face class or the nonface class. Experiments using images from the MIT-CMU test sets demonstrate the feasibility of our new face detection method. In particular, when using 92 images (containing 282 faces) from the MIT-CMU test sets, our DFA-SVM method achieves 98.2% correct face detection rate with two false detections.

#!The NNSA's Y-12 National Security Complex is a manufacturing facility operated by BWXT Y-12. Y-12's missions include ensuring the US' nuclear weapons deterrent, storing nuclear materials, and fueling US naval reactors. As a consequence of these missions, Y-12 makes dozens of products, having hundreds of parts, each with many different process steps associated with manufacturing components, building sub-assemblies, or assembling final products. Y-12 also disassembles weapon components to support stockpile reduction efforts and retrieve high-value materials and parts. These efforts must be coordinated not only within the Y-12 complex but also within the nation-wide nuclear weapons complex. Y-12 relies heavily on simulation models to evaluate the impact of plant changes over multiple programs and products, spanning multiple-years, and involving multiple interacting organizations. To maintain these simulations with current data and build and execute them rapidly, Y-12's simulation modeling group relies heavily on database-intensive simulations described in this paper.

#!We present a method for generating surface crack patterns that appear in materials such as mud, ceramic glaze, and glass. To model these phenomena, we build upon existing physically based methods. Our algorithm generates cracks from a stress field defined heuristically over a triangle discretization of the surface. The simulation produces cracks by evolving this field over time. The user can control the characteristics and appearance of the cracks using a set of simple parameters. By changing these parameters, we have generated examples similar to a variety of crack patterns found in the real world. We assess the realism of our results by comparison with photographs of real-world examples. Using a physically based approach also enables us to generate animations similar to time-lapse photography.

#!This paper presents a simulation model which describes the operations in the Emergency Department of Special Health Care at the Central Hospital of Jyv&auml;skyl&auml;, Finland. It can be used to test different process scenarios, allocate resources and perform activity based cost analysis. By using the simulation model we demonstrate a new operational method, which makes the operation of the Emergency Department of Special Health Care more effective. This operational method is called the triage-team method and it has been studied from two different points of view. The results showed that this method improves the operation of the Emergency Department of Special Health Care substantially (over 25%), if it is implemented properly and includes all the necessary tasks.

#!We define and study bisimulation for proving contextual equivalence in an aspect extension of the untyped lambda-calculus. To our knowledge, this is the first study of coinductive reasoning principles aimed at proving equality of aspect programs. The language we study is very small, yet powerful enough to encode mutable references and a range of temporal pointcuts (including cflow and regular event patterns).Examples suggest that our bisimulation principle is useful. For an encoding of higher-order programs with state, our methods suffice to establish well-known and well-studied subtle examples involving higher-order functions with state.Even in the presence of first class dynamic advice and expressive pointcuts, our reasoning principles show that aspect-aware interfaces can aid in ensuring that clients of a component are unaffected by changes to an implementation. Our paper generalizes existing results given for open modules to also include a variety of history-sensitive pointcuts such as cflow and regular event patterns.Our formal techniques and results suggest that aspects are amenable to the formal techniques developed for stateful higher-order programs.

#!The currently popular distributed, n-tiered, object-oriented application architecture provokes many design debates. Designs of such applications are often divided into logical 'tiers' -- usually user interface, business logic and domain object, or data, tiers, each with their own design issues. In particular, the latter contains data that needs to be stored and retrieved from permanent storage. Decisions need to be made as to the most appropriate way of doing this -- the choices are usually whether to use an object database, to communicate directly with a relational database, or to use object-relational mapping (ORM) tools to allow objects to be translated to and from relational form.Most often, depending on the perceived profile of the application, architects make these decisions using rules of thumb derived from particular experience or the design patterns literature. Examples include: object-oriented databases ease programming, relational databases ease report generation and data mining; object-oriented databases are good for navigation around an object model, relational databases are good for sequential processing and complex queries; if you are writing an application from scratch, use an object database, if you need to integrate to various sources of legacy data, use an ORM tool. Although helpful, these rules are often highly context-dependent and are often misapplied.Research into the nature and magnitude of 'design forces' in this area has resulted in a series of benchmarks, intended to allow architects to more clearly understand the implications of design decisions concerning object persistence. In this paper, the performance of selected open source object persistence tools is investigated, to attempt to clarify the myths surrounding the performance of the different options. In particular, we compare Hibernate, representative of the ORM stable, and db4o, representative of object-oriented databases. The OO7 benchmark is used to compare the speed of execution of a suite of typical persistence-related operations in both candidates. We then propose some preliminary explanations of the sometimes surprising results.

#!This paper presents a Parameter Design (PD) approach that provides near-optimal settings to the process parameters of a single lathe machine with high-volume production. Optimized process parameters include both machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) and production parameters (material order size and inventory safety stock and reorder point). In high-volume production, machining parameters have amplified impacts on the machine performance in terms of productivity (cycle time), reliability (tool life), and product quality (surface finish). In addition, production parameters become critical in high-volume production since they directly impact the overall order fulfillment (production makespan and delivery reliability). Hence, this paper extends the conventional per-part machining cost model into a per-order production cost model by consolidating the production economics of both machining parameters and production controls. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is utilized to capture the stochastic and dynamic production attributes and to transfer the static machine PD model into a dynamic PD-DES production model. The model is also utilized to accumulate the per-order running cost over production time while incorporating the impacts of process variability in tool life, labor efficiency, machining conditions, order lead time, and demand rate. Using the PD-DES model as a dynamic fitness function, a Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) is developed and applied to a CNC lathe machine to determine near-optimal settings to both machining and production process parameters so that the overall per-order production cost is minimized. Results showed effective SGA convergence profile with relatively low number of search generations. Sensitivity analysis with SGA parameters is conducted to demonstrate the search's robustness. The benefits of the per-order cost model are illustrated by repeating the SGA solution using machine productivity as a fitness criterion. The new SGA solution resulted in a better productivity but at a higher per-order cost. Finally, the effectiveness of SGA search is illustrated by outperforming the solutions obtained from two-level and three-level full factorial designs.

#!As various services are provided as web applications, attacks against web applications constitute a serious problem. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.

#*Electronic medical records and computerized physician order entry: examining factors and methods that foster clinician it acceptance in pediatric hospitals
#@Julie A. Jacko
#t2006

#index8271
#!The healthcare industry and others have acknowledged the potential for information technology systems (IT) such as electronic medical records (EMR) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to improve quality of patient care and especially patient safety. Thus the US government, businesses, and other groups are advocating adoption of these systems by hospitals and other care providers. This research study endeavors to examine the factors that contribute to clinician acceptance of EMR and CPOE systems and apply this new knowledge to ensure that methods used to implement these systems foster clinician acceptance and other aspects of system success. A review of lessons from past EMR/CPOE successes and failures demonstrates two factors commonly observed in implementations that achieve positive (versus negative) outcomes: (1) designing a system that is usable by clinicians in the clinical work context, and (2) adequately preparing users to adopt changes associated with the implementation. Based on this, a framework for User-Centered Implementation (UCI) is presented. This framework combines methods from user-centered design and change management to provide an implementation methodology that addresses these factors during implementation and improves the likelihood that positive outcomes are achieved. Next, this study examines clinician acceptance of an EMR/CPOE system implemented in a pediatric hospital system, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (Children's). Children's was selected for this research because they have employed an implementation approach founded in user-centered implementation principles and methods. The study examined physician, nurse, and other staff perceptions about the system's usefulness (performance expectancy (PE)) and ease of use (effort expectancy (EE)) both prior to and following system implementation. The pre- and post-implementation models demonstrate that the factors that influence PE change over time. Compatibility with work practices was important both prior to and following implementation. Prior to implementation, users who perceived a greater need for the system and felt that their needs were represented in the design process also had higher expectations of the impact the system would have on their job performance. After implementation, PE ratings were influenced primarily by characteristics of the system. These characteristics included how well the system supported clinical decision making, facilitated sharing information, and how easy it was to use (EE). One aspect of the rollout process, the support provided by super users, also had a positive impact on PE and EE after implementation. This finding highlights the importance of having front-line support resources available on the units. Because Children's employed a UCI-based implementation approach, it was expected that good levels of user acceptance of the EMR/CPOE would be achieved. Study results indicate Children's implementation achieved positive perceptions of system ease of use (EE). However, this ease of use did not consistently translate to favorable ratings of the systems' impact on individual job performance. Post-implementation PE ratings remained neutral or positive for most user subgroups, a finding likely related to the fact that during this intermediate stage of the implementation both the paper chart and EMR must be used. Managing these dual locations for patient information may be contributing to predominantly neutral, rather than positive, PE ratings since this limits the ability of the system to contribute to gains in personal efficiency and effectiveness. The findings on factors that influence PE and EE, two aspects of technology acceptance, and the PE and EE levels achieved with Children's EMR were applied to provide further guidance for using UCI to achieve clinician acceptance of EMR systems. Designing EMR/CPOE systems that are usable within the clinical work context is important because it enables clinicians to focus time and energy on the patient, rather than on using the system. Accomplishing this in practice is difficult given the complexity of these systems and the dynamic clinical care processes they must support. However, the UCI framework presented here can be effectively applied to EMR/CPOE implementations to ensure the usability, utility, and, consequently, acceptance of these systems.

#!Designing and explaining programs are often difficult tasks, especially when novices are involved. It also concerns more experienced programmers when complex algorithms need to be carefully explained and documented as part of software development.Good practice suggests that code and documentation be tightly coupled; but there are only a few support tools specifically targeted at novices that require this as an integral part of the programming process. We propose a new tool design with this objective in mind: P-Coder gives a flexible descriptive view of the program via pseudocode notation within a graphical tree-structured model, from which the complete algorithm can be specified to retain the informal description integrated with the final code. Thus the code meets some of the key requirements for realizing a literate program.

Both systems change their forecasts as new data is received. We use one long term running simulation that self corrects using out of order, imperfect sensor data. The DDDAS versions replace codes that were previously run using data only in initial conditions. DDDAS entails the ability to dynamically incorporate additional data into an executing application, and in reverse, the ability of an application to dynamically steer the measurement process.

Types of frictions under consideration include fixed and proportional transaction costs, bid-ask spreads, taxes, and upper bounds on the number of units for transaction. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of arbitrage. In addition, we obtain some negative result on computational difficulty in general for arbitrage under those frictions: it is NP-complete to identify whether there exists a cash-and-carry arbitrage transaction and it is NP-hard to find an optimal cash-and-carry arbitrage transaction.

#!With the advancement of wireless networks and mobile access devices such as cell phones and PDAs, multimedia services could be offered through wireless broadcast networks to these mobile devices. Therefore, there is a need to securely deliver multimedia content/data to many users over an insecure channel. Broadcast encryption scheme could provide this solution. The first formal study of broadcast encryption scheme is by Fiat and Noar in 1993. Since then, many broadcast encryption schemes have been proposed to improve the efficiency which is measured by three parameters, that is, length of transmission messages, users' storage and computational overhead at a user device. Some broadcast encryption schemes require less users storage, but the length of transmission messages or computation overhead depends on the number of users. In this paper, we proposed an authenticated broadcast encryption scheme which has an additional property than current proposed broadcast encryption schemes, that is, all users can verify who the sender is. The proposed scheme is proved to be secure against chosen ciphertext attacks based on the decision l-bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption. Furthermore, the simulation results, transmission messages nearly independent of the number of users and reasonable user storage show that the proposed authenticated broadcast encryption scheme is efficient and suitable for mobile devices.

#!Spoken medical dialogue is a valuable source of information for patients and caregivers. This work presents a first step towards automatic analysis and summarization of spoken medical dialogue. We first abstract a dialogue into a sequence of semantic categories using linguistic and contextual features integrated in a supervised machine-learning framework. Our model has a classification accuracy of 73%, compared to 33% achieved by a majority baseline (p < 0.01). We then describe and implement a summarizer that utilizes this automatically induced structure. Our evaluation results indicate that automatically generated summaries exhibit high resemblance to summaries wIitten by humans. In addition, task-based evaluation shows that physicians can reasonably answer questions related to patient care by looking at the automatically generated summaries alone, in contrast to the physicians' performance when they were given summaries from a naïve summarizer (p < 0.05). This work demonstrates the feasibility of automatically structuring and summarizing spoken medical dialogue.

In this paper, we present an Online arbitration environment that we believe facilitates the participants in a meaningful way. Our assumption is that an ODR service should be easy to use (convenient), and at the same time provide meaningful support. More specifically we have paid attention to four criteria that we believe are important, viz. simplicity, awareness, orientation and timeliness. The online arbitration service is called GearBi.

#!In classification of binary featured data, distance computation is carried out by considering each feature. We represent the given binary data as run-length encoded data. This would lead to a compact or compressed representation of data. Further, we propose an algorithm to directly compute the Manhattan distance between two such binary encoded patterns. We show that classification of data in such compressed form would improve the computation time by a factor of 5 on large handwritten data. The scheme is useful in large data clustering and classification which depend on distance measures.

#!The aim of this work is to develop a well-balanced central weighted essentially non-oscillatory (CWENO) method, fourth-order accurate in space and time, for shallow water system of balance laws with bed slope source term. Time accuracy is obtained applying a Runge-Kutta scheme (RK), coupled with the natural continuous extension (NCE) approach. Space accuracy is obtained using WENO reconstructions of the conservative variables and of the water-surface elevation. Extension of the applicability of the standard CWENO scheme to very irregular bottoms, preserving high-order accuracy, is obtained introducing two original procedures. The former involves the evaluation of the point-values of the flux derivative, coupled with the bed slope source term. The latter involves the spatial integration of the source term, analytically manipulated to take advantage from the regularity of the free-surface elevation, usually smoother than the bottom elevation. Both these procedures satisfy the C-property, the property of exactly preserving the quiescent flow. Several standard one-dimensional test cases are used to verify high-order accuracy, exact C-property, and good resolution properties for smooth and discontinuous solutions.

#!We present a new algorithm for active learning embedded within an interactive calendar management system that learns its users' scheduling preferences. When the system receives a meeting request, the active learner selects a set of alternative solutions to present to the user; learning is then achieved by noting the user's preferences for the selected schedule over the others presented. To achieve the goals of presenting solutions that meet the user's needs while enhancing the preference-learning process, we introduce a new approach to active learning that makes online decisions about the technique to use in selecting the schedules to present in response to each meeting request. The decision is based on the entropy of the available options: a highly diverse set of possible solutions calls for a selection technique that chooses instances that are different from one another, maximizing coarse-grained learning, whereas a set of possible solutions containing little diversity is met with a selection strategy that promotes fine-grained learning. We present experimental results that indicate that our entropy-driven approach provides a better balance between learning efficiency and user satisfaction than static selection techniques.

#cBioinformatics
#index8376
#!Motivation: Global gene expression measurements as obtained, for example, in microarray experiments can provide important clues to the underlying transcriptional control mechanisms and network structure of a biological cell. In the absence of a detailed understanding of this gene regulation, current attempts at classification of expression data rely on clustering and pattern recognition techniques employing ad-hoc similarity criteria. To improve this situation, a better understanding of the expected relationships between expression profiles of genes associated by biological function is required. Results: It is shown that perturbation expansions familiar from biological systems theory make precise predictions for the types of relationships to be expected for expression profiles of biologically associated genes, even if the underlying biological factors responsible for this association are not known. Classification criteria are derived, most of which are not usually employed in clustering algorithms. The approach is illustrated by using the AtGenExpress Arabidopsis thaliana developmental expression map.

#!Feature extraction is among the most important problems in face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) algorithm called kernel fractional-step discriminant analysis (KFDA) for nonlinear feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Not only can this new algorithm, like other kernel methods, deal with nonlinearity required for many face recognition tasks, it can also outperform traditional KDA algorithms in resisting the adverse effects due to outlier classes. Moreover, to further strengthen the overall performance of KDA algorithms for face recognition, we propose two new kernel functions: cosine fractional-power polynomial kernel and non-normal Gaussian RBF kernel. We perform extensive comparative studies based on the YaleB and FERET face databases. Experimental results show that our KFDA algorithm outperforms traditional kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and KDA algorithms. Moreover, further improvement can be obtained when the two new kernel functions are used.

#cPattern Recognition
#index8381
#!This paper presents a novel image-hiding method that exhibits a high hiding capacity that allows the embedded important image to be larger than the cover image, a facility that is seldom described in the literature. In the proposed method, the entire important image is divided into many nonoverlapping blocks. For each block of the important image, a block-matching procedure is used to search for the best similar block from a series of numbered candidate blocks. The obtained indices of the best-matching blocks are encoded using Huffman coding scheme, and then recorded in the least-significant-bit planes of the cover image through a monoalphabetic transposition cipher. The proposed method exhibits the following advantages over existing methods: (1) a high hiding capacity such that the embedded important image can be larger than the cover image; (2) a stego-image with a high quality, which improves the secrecy of the hidden image; and (3) a small error between the extracted important image and the original important image indicating that the extracted important image is of acceptable quality.

#!This paper proposes a methodology that allows users to control character's motion interactively but continuously. Inspired by the work of Gleicher et al. [GSKJ03], we propose a semi-automatic method to build fat graphs where a node corresponds to a pose and its incoming and outgoing edges represent the motion segments starting from and ending at similar poses. A group of edges is built into a fat edge that parameterizes similar motion segments into a blendable form. Employing the existing motion transition and blending methods, our run-time system allows users to control a character interactively in continuous parameter spaces with conventional input devices such as joysticks and the mice. The capability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through several applications. Although our method has some limitations on motion repertories and qualities, it can be adapted to a number of real-world applications including video games and virtual reality applications.

#!In this paper the author presents a distributed simulation system for disaster response activities based on the High Level Architecture (HLA). This simulation system focuses on resource management issues including the allocation of scarce response resources to operational areas and it consists of three major components: (1) simulators for the disaster environment, e.g., simulators for damages, casualties and fire spread, (2) simulators for the operations of personnel and technical equipment and (3) some auxiliary simulators. A Multiagent System which models resource allocation tasks within an Emergency Operation Center (EOC) is linked to this simulation. This paper describes the overall architecture of the system and presents some results based on a prototype implementation.

#!As modern operating systems and software become larger and more complex, they are more likely to contain bugs, which may allow attackers to gain illegitimate access. A fast and reliable mechanism to discern and generate vaccines for such attacks is vital for the successful protection of networks and systems. In this paper we present Argos, a containment environment for worms as well as human orchestrated attacks. Argos is built upon a fast x86 emulator which tracks network data throughout execution to identify their invalid use as jump targets, function addresses, instructions, etc. Furthermore, system call policies disallow the use of network data as arguments to certain calls. When an attack is detected, we perform 'intelligent' process- or kernel-aware logging of the corresponding emulator state for further offline processing. In addition, our own forensics shellcode is injected, replacing the malevolent shellcode, to gather information about the attacked process. By correlating the data logged by the emulator with the data collected from the network, we are able to generate accurate network intrusion detection signatures for the exploits that are immune to payload mutations. The entire process can be automated and has few if any false positives, thus rapid global scale deployment of the signatures is possible.

#!Slow websites infuriate users. Lots of people can visit your web site or use your web application - but you have to be prepared for those visitors, or they won't come back. Your sites need to be built to withstand the problems success creates. Building Scalable Web Sites looks at a variety of techniques for creating sites that can keep users cheerful even when there are thousands or millions of them. Flickr.com developer, Cal Henderson, explains how to build sites so that large numbers of visitors can enjoy them. Henderson examines techniques that go beyond sheer speed, exploring how to coordinate developers, support international users, and integrate with other services from email to SOAP to RSS to the APIs exposed by many Ajax-based web applications. This book uncovers the secrets that you need to know for back-end scaling, architecture and failover so your websites can handle countless requests. You'll learn how to take the "poor man's web technologies" - Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP or other scripting languages - and scale them to compete with established "store bought" enterprise web technologies. Toward the end of the book, you'll discover techniques for keeping web applications running with event monitoring and long-term statistical tracking for capacity planning. If you're about to build your first dynamic website, then Building Scalable Web Sites isn't for you. But if you're an advanced developer who's ready to realize the cost and performance benefits of a comprehensive approach to scalable applications, then let your fingers do the walking through this convenient guide.

#!We study the problem of exchanging messages within a fixed group of k nodes, called participants, in an n-node radio network, modeled as an undirected graph. This communication task was previously considered in the setting of ATM video applications, in [J.M. Tsai, H.-H. Fang, C.-Y. Lee, A multicast solution for ATM video applications, IEEE Trans. Circuits Systems Video Technol. 7 (1997) 675-686], and was called multipoint-to-multipoint (M2M) multicasting. While the radio network topology is known to all nodes, it is assumed that no node is aware of the location of the participants. We give a distributed deterministic algorithm for the M2M multicasting problem in radio networks, and analyze its time complexity. We show that if the maximum distance between any two out of k participants is d then this local information exchange problem can be solved in time O(d log2 n + k log4 n).

#!Software maintenance is expensive and difficult because soft-ware is complex and maintenance requires the understanding of code written by someone else. A prerequisite to maintainability is program understanding, specifically, understanding the control flows between software components. This is especially problematic for emerging software technologies, such as the World Wide Web, because of the lack of formal development practices and because web applications comprise a mix of static and dynamic content. Adequate representations are therefore necessary to facilitate program understanding. This research proposes an approach called READABLE (Readable, Executable, Augmentable Database-Linked Environment) that generates executable, tabular representations that can be used to both understand and manipulate software applications. A controlled laboratory experiment carried out to test the efficacy of the approach demonstrates that the representations significantly enhance program understanding. The results suggest that the approach and the corresponding environment may be useful to alleviate problems associated with the software maintainability of new web applications.

#!We present a new method based on the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve to efficiently select a feature subset in classifying a high-dimensional microarray dataset with a limited number of observations. Our method has two steps: (1) selecting the most relevant features to the target label using the ROC curve and (2) iteratively eliminating a redundant feature using the ROC curves. The ROC curve is strongly related with a non-parametric hypothesis testing, which must be effective for a dataset with small numerical observations. Experiments with real datasets revealed the significant performance advantage of our method over two competing feature subset selection methods.

#!In this paper, we shall propose a novel image-hiding scheme. Our new scheme classifies the host image pixels into two groups of pixels according to the pixel values. For each group of pixels, the corresponding secret pixel values go through an optimal substitution process and are transformed into other pixel values by following the dynamic programming strategy. Then, we can embed the transformed pixel values in the host pixels by using the modulus functions and obtain the stego-image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our new method is capable of offering better stego-image quality than a number of well-accepted schemes.

#!Distributed simulation has undergone several cycles of ups and downs in recent years. Although successful in the military domain, it appears that the idea of applying distributed simulation in other fields for modeling and analysis of large-scale, heterogeneous systems such as communication networks or supply chains has still not taken off until today. Is this because of inherent limitations or lack of applicability as such? Or is it because of additional research issues that are yet to be resolved to make distributed simulation applicable? In this paper, the problem is discussed specifically with regard to the application of distributed simulation for design, operation and performance enhancement of manufacturing and logistics systems.

#!Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is an architectural technique that improves resource utilization by allowing instructions from multiple threads to coexist in a processor and share resources. However, earlier studies have shown that the performance of an SMT architecture begins to saturate as the number of coexisting threads increases beyond four. We show that no single fetch policy can be the best solution during the entire execution time and that a significant performance improvement can be attained by dynamically switching the fetch policies. We propose an implementation method which includes an extremely lightweight thread to control fetch policies (a detector thread) and a processor architecture to run the detector thread without impact on the user application threads. We evaluate various heuristics for the detector thread to determine the best fetch policies. We show that, with eight threads running on our simulated SMT, the proposed approach can outperform fixed scheduling mechanisms by up to 30%.

#!In order to achieve Predictive Battlespace Awareness, representations of the battlespace must be accurate and timely. They must also provide predictive and actionable information to the user. Planners must be able to predict the impact of friendly operations on the enemy in order to stay inside his decision cycle. Further, they must be able to dynamically adapt an effects-based plan based on assessment of operations and the campaign. This paper outlines an operator-centered program for developing the models needed to provide the information and a systems engineering approach to designing visualizations which convey the information output to decision makers. Fundamental to the process is warfighter involvement at all phases.

Providing a compatible option with all of the technical features of .NET without the restrictive licensing and prohibitive costs that Microsoft imposes, the Mono project was initiated and co-financed by Ximian Corporation for the development of an open source version of .NET Framework for Linux/Unix and Windows platforms (Mac OS X support will be added)..Mono will allow cross-platform programming and operating of .NET compatible applications. Experts see the presence of a Unix-compatible version as decisive for the success of .NET.Mono Kick Start is a practical introduction to Mono and .NET compatible application programming with Mono. After a classically structured crash-course on the C# language and Monoï¾¿s own compiler, the authors reach down deeper to subjects like threads, network programming, security, database interaction, XML, and more.A comprehensive practical section shows you how to set up Web applications with Mono, how GUIs can be programmed using GTK, and how applications written with .NET can be operated in the Mono framework.

#!Welcome to Data Base 2.0! Things are different, now; it's a new year and a new publication. A new editorial team is in place and we have new financial supporters to support the editorial process. This permits us to undertake initiatives to increase the scope and impact of Data Base. We are promoting new topic coverage and geographical coverage, we have a new scope, and we are building the basis of a new level of impact for this important ACM publication, as part of this new initiative.It's an all-new Data Base, with global editorial coverage and a new online manuscript submission and review system to facilitate global participation by the community of information systems and technology scholars. Visit our new Internet resources at http://the-database.org.I'm Tom Stafford (tstaffor@memphis.edu), Editor-in-Chief, stationed at the logistics hub of the West in Memphis, Tennessee; my Global Co-Editor, Patrick Chau (pchau@business.hku.hk), is stationed at the logistics hub of the East in Hong Kong. Together, with an online review system stationed online at Editorial Manager.com (http://www.editorialmanager.com/SIGMISDB), and citation analysis and impact scoring evaluated by Thompson Scientific, we anticipate greatly increased global presence and visibility with this important publication.In a field where we admittedly do not provide enough premium publication outlets for our scholars, it's time to start building a new premium marquee. That marquee is the new, improved, and ever-popular Data Base for Advances in Information Systems.As we undertake this important new initiative, we owe everything we intend to do to the diligent and successful efforts of Dorothy Leidner and Wynne Chin, who have nurtured and grown the publication thus far - building visibility, maintaining rigor and standards, promoting access and participation. We take what they have built and launch it on a truly global scale with the innovation of global editorship and global editorial access through our online review system.We continue to benefit from the sage advice and superior production capabilities of the prior technical management team, and are thoroughly pleased to announce that Managing Editor Andrew Schwarz and Technical Editor Denny Kramer continue with us through this important evolution in the growth of Data Base. In the interim period of transition to new editorial offices and the online review system, Andrew will continue to field new manuscript submissions via email (aschwarz@lsu.edu), while Denny (denny_kramer@baylor.edu) continues to prepare manuscripts in flow for completion and publication.It's new, it's important, and it's going places, world-wide: the new Data Base. Please join us as we grow!

#!Usage-based or congestion-based charging schemes have been regarded as a relevant way to control congestion and to differentiate services among users in telecommunication networks; auctioning for bandwidth appears as one of several possibilities. In a previous work, the authors designed a multibid auction scheme where users compete for bandwidth at a link by submitting several couples (e.g., amount of bandwidth asked, associated unit price) so that the link allocates the bandwidth and computes the charge according to the second price principle. They showed that incentive compatibility and efficiency among other properties are verified. We propose in the present paper to extend this scheme to the case of a network by using the properties/ assumptions that the backbone network is overprovisioned and the access networks have a tree structure.

#!We consider the problem of covering an orthogonal polygon with a minimum number of axis-parallel rectangles from a computational point of view. We propose an integer program which is the first general approach to obtain provably optimal solutions to this well-studied NP-hard problem. It applies to common variants like covering only the corners or the boundary of the polygon and also to the weighted case. In experiments, it turns out that the linear programming relaxation is extremely tight and rounding a fractional solution is an immediate high-quality heuristic. We obtain excellent experimental results for polygons originating from VLSI design, fax data sheets, black and white images, and for random instances. Making use of the dual linear program, we propose a stronger lower bound on the optimum, namely, the cardinality of a fractional stable set. Furthermore, we outline ideas how to make use of this bound in primal--dual-based algorithms. We give partial results, which make us believe that our proposals have a strong potential to settle the main open problem in the area: To find a constant factor approximation algorithm for the rectangle cover problem.

#!We presented a new color-texture image segmentation method that combined directional operators and the JSEG (J measure based SEGmentation) algorithm. In particular, two major contributions were set forth in this paper. (1) The two measures defined in JSEG and HSEG (H measure based SEGmentation) were discussed respectively and then we found the over-segmentation problem of JSEG could be attributed partly to the absence of color discontinuity in the J measure. Moreover, we have also proven in essence the H measure is isotropic operators for edge detection in images. (2) A new measure was proposed by integrating directional operators into the J measure, on which our segmentation method was based. The new segmentation method took account of both textural homogeneity and color discontinuity in local regions. Performance improvement due to the proposed modification was demonstrated on a variety of real color images.

#!To simplify the task of proving termination and AC-termination of term rewriting systems, elimination transformations have been vigorously studied since the 1990s. Dummy elimination, distribution elimination, general dummy elimination, and improved general dummy elimination are examples of elimination transformations. In this paper we clarify the essence of elimination transformations based on the notion of dependency pairs. We first present a theorem that gives a general and essential property for elimination transformations, making them sound with AC-termination. Based on the theorem, we design an elimination transformation called the argument filtering transformation. Next, we clarify the relation among various elimination transformations by comparing them with a corresponding restricted argument filtering transformation. Finally, we compare the AC-dependency pair method with the argument filtering transformation.

#*Detecting anomalies in cross-classified streams: a Bayesian approach
#@Deepak Agarwal
#t2006
#cKnowledge and Information Systems
#index8499
#!We consider the problem of detecting anomalies in data that arise as multidimensional arrays with each dimension corresponding to the levels of a categorical variable. In typical data mining applications, the number of cells in such arrays are usually large. Our primary focus is detecting anomalies by comparing information at the current time to historical data. Naive approaches advocated in the process control literature do not work well in this scenario due to the multiple testing problem&#x2014;performing multiple statistical tests on the same data produce excessive number of false positives. We use an empirical Bayes method which works by fitting a two-component Gaussian mixture to deviations at current time. The approach is scalable to problems that involve monitoring massive number of cells and fast enough to be potentially useful in many streaming scenarios. We show the superiority of the method relative to a naive &#x201c;per component error rate&#x201d; procedure through simulation. A novel feature of our technique is the ability to suppress deviations that are merely the consequence of sharp changes in the marginal distributions. This research was motivated by the need to extract critical application information and business intelligence from the daily logs that accompany large-scale spoken dialog systems. We illustrate our method on one such system.

#!When two topologically identical shapes are blended, various possible transformation paths exist from the source shape to the target shape. Which one is the most plausible? Here we propose that the transformation process should obey a quasi-physical law. This paper combines morphing with deformation theory from continuum mechanics. By using strain energy, which reflects the magnitude of deformation, as an objective function, we convert the problem of path interpolation into an unconstrained optimization problem. To reduce the number of variables in the optimization we adopt shape functions, as used in the finite element method (FEM). A point-to-point correspondence between the source and target shapes is naturally established using these polynomial functions plus a distance map.

#@David Nott

#cComputational Statistics
#index8503
#!Flexible modelling of the response variance in regression is interesting for understanding the causes of variability in the responses, and is crucial for efficient estimation and correct inference for mean parameters. In this paper we describe methods for mean and variance estimation where the responses are modelled using the double exponential family of distributions and mean and dispersion parameters are described as an additive function of predictors. The additive terms in the model are represented by penalized splines. A simple and unified computational methodology is presented for carrying out the calculations required for Bayesian inference in this class of models based on an adaptive Metropolis algorithm. Application of the adaptive Metropolis algorithm is fully automatic and does not require any kind of pretuning runs. The methodology presented provides flexible methods for modelling heterogeneous Gaussian data, as well as overdispersed and underdispersed count data. Performance is considered in a variety of examples involving real and simulated data sets.

#!Incomplete, inaccurate, ambiguous, and vola-tile requirements have plagued the software industry since its inception. The convergence of model-based development and formal methods offers developers of safety-critical systems a powerful new approach to the early validation of requirements. This paper describes an exercise conducted to determine if formal methods could be used to validate system requirements early in the lifecycle at reasonable cost. Several hundred functional and safety requirements for the mode logic of a typical flight guidance system were captured as natural language &#x201c;shall&#x201d; statements. A formal model of the mode logic was written in the RSML&#x2212;e language and translated into the NuSMV model checker and the PVS theorem prover using translators developed as part of the project. Each &#x201c;shall&#x201d; statement was manually translated into a NuSMV or PVS property and proven using these tools. Numerous errors were found in both the original requirements and the RSML&#x2212;e model. This demonstrates that formal models can be written for realistic systems and that formal analysis tools have matured to the point where they can be effectively used to find errors before implementation.

#!This paper shows how to construct a linear deformable model for graph structure by performing principal components analysis (PCA) on the vectorised adjacency matrix. We commence by using correspondence information to place the nodes of each of a set of graphs in a standard reference order. Using the correspondences order, we convert the adjacency matrices to long-vectors and compute the long-vector covariance matrix. By projecting the vectorised adjacency matrices onto the leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, we embed the graphs in a pattern-space. We illustrate the utility of the resulting method for shape-analysis.

#!In this paper, a novel automatic image annotation system is proposed, which integrates two sets of support vector machines (SVMs), namely the multiple instance learning (MIL)-based and global-feature-based SVMs, for annotation. The MIL-based bag features are obtained by applying MIL on the image blocks, where the enhanced diversity density (DD) algorithm and a faster searching algorithm are applied to improve the efficiency and accuracy. They are further input to a set of SVMs for finding the optimum hyperplanes to annotate training images. Similarly, global color and texture features, including color histogram and modified edge histogram, are fed into another set of SVMs for categorizing training images. Consequently, two sets of image features are constructed for each test image and are, respectively, sent to the two sets of SVMs, whose outputs are incorporated by an automatic weight estimation method to obtain the final annotation results. Our proposed annotation approach demonstrates a promising performance for an image database of 12000 general-purpose images from COREL, as compared with some current peer systems in the literature.

#!One aim of component-based software engineering (CBSE) is to enable the prediction of extra-functional properties, such as performance and reliability, utilising a well-defined composition theory. Nowadays, such theories and their accompanying prediction methods are still in a maturation stage. Several factors influencing extra-functional properties need additional research to be understood. A special problem in CBSE stems from its specific development process: Software components should be specified and implemented independent from their later context to enable reuse. Thus, extra-functional properties of components need to be specified in a parametric way to take different influence factors like the hardware platform or the usage profile into account. In our approach, we use the Palladio Component Model (PCM) to specify component-based software architectures in a parametric way. This model offers direct support of the CBSE development process by dividing the model creation among the developer roles. In this paper, we present our model and a simulation tool based on it, which is capable of making performance predictions. Within a case study, we show that the resulting prediction accuracy can be sufficient to support the evaluation of architectural design decisions.

The problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and extremely difficult to solve in practice. We characterize relevant subclasses of packing and present an algorithm which is able to solve moderately large instances to optimality. Extensive computational experiments compare the algorithm for the three-dimensional bin packing when solving general orthogonal packings and when restricted to robot packings.

#!Move over Final Cut Pro. There's a new king of the digital video editing hill, and it doesn't even work on a Mac (though it may be enough to lure some Mac loyalists over). Eschewing cross-platform support for a focus on speed, features, and a quickness to market that was impossible to achieve with both Mac and Windows versions, the brand-new Windows XPï¾¿only Adobe Premiere Pro sets a new standard for desktop digital video editing. Here to get you up to speed on it quickly and efficiently is the first and last word on the subject from the folks behind Premiere Pro--the Adobe Creative Team. This project-based volume covers not just the basics of working with audio, creating transitions, and producing titles but also all that's new (and revolutionary) in Premiere Pro: three-point color correction, multiple timelines, a new audio mixer, enhanced media management, and more. Best of all, the accompanying DVD includes real footage that you can practice on! The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright © 2010 ACM, Inc.

#!Our goal is to create an &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo; 3D agent able to send complex, &lsquo;natural&rsquo; messages to users and, in the future, to converse with them. We look at the relationship between the agent's communicative intentions and the way that these intentions are expressed into verbal and nonverbal messages. In this paper, we concentrate on the study and generation of coordinated linguistic and gaze communicative acts. In this view we analyse gaze signals according to their functional meaning rather than to their physical actions. We propose a formalism where a communicative act is represented by two elements: a meaning (that corresponds to a set of goals and beliefs that the agent has the purpose to transmit to the interlocutor) and a signal, that is the nonverbal expression of that meaning. We also outline a methodology to generate messages that coordinate verbal with nonverbal signals.

#!At Eurocrypt'05, Wang et al. presented efficient collision attacks on MD5 and MD4 hash functions. They found a collision of MD5 with a complexity of less than 237 MD5 hash operations, and a collision of MD4 with complexity less than 28 MD4 hash operations. In their attack, the procedure to generate a collision is divided into 4 steps. First, they determine the message differential and output differentials of chaining variables in each step, which generates a collision with small complexity. Second, they construct sufficient conditions that guarantee that the desired differential is always calculated. Third, they find a message modification that can satisfy the sufficient conditions with high probability. Finally, they search for a message that satisfies all sufficient conditions. In this paper, we focus on the message modification of MD5 and MD4, and propose a new message modification. Using our message modification, a collision of MD5 can be found with complexity less than 229 MD5 hash operations, and a collision of MD4 can be found with complexity less than 3 MD4 hash operations. To improve the complexity from previous attacks, we mainly use two ideas. The first idea is to use message modification that can satisfy more sufficient conditions in the second round than in previous attacks. The second idea is to use message modification that can enable us to search for a collision starting from an intermediate step.

#!In this paper, we study problems related to supporting unicast and multicast connections with quality of service (QoS) requirements. We investigate the problem of optimal routing and resource allocation in the context of performance dependent costs. In this context, each network element can offer several QoS guarantees, each associated with a different cost. This is a natural extension to the commonly used bi-criteria model, where each link is associated with a single delay and a single cost. This framework is simple yet strong enough to model many practical interesting networking problems.An important problems in this framework is finding a good path for a connection that minimizes the cost while retaining the end-to-end delay requirement. Once such a path (or a tree, in the multicast case) is found, one needs to partition the end-to-end QoS requirements among the links of the path (tree). We consider the case of general integer cost functions (where delays and cost are integers). As the related problem is NP complete, we concentrate on finding efficient ε-approximation solutions. We improve on recent previous results by Ergün et al. Lorenz and Orda, and Raz and Shavitt, both in terms of generality as well as in terms of complexity of the solution. In particular, we present novel approximation techniques that yield the best known complexity for the unicast QoS routing problem, and the first approximation algorithm for the QoS partition problem on trees, both for the centralized and distributed cases.

#!Macromedia Flash is fast becoming the Web's most widely used platform for creating rich media with animation and motion graphics, but mastering Flash isn't easy. Most entry-level books teach through simple examples that concentrate on either animation or scripting, but rarely both together. To get the most from Flash 8, you not only need to be proficient in programming/interface design, you need the creativity for story telling and the artistic insights to design fluid animation.Flash 8: Projects for Learning Animation and Interactivity teaches Flash design rather than simply Flash itself. With a standalone series of walkthroughs and tutorials for Flash beginners coming from a graphics field, this book teaches Flash in the context of real-world projects. Rather than learn a Flash tool for the sake of it, you learn which areas of Flash are important, and which are less used, simply by seeing how typical content is actually created. And rather than a text-heavy approach, this graphically rich book leads you through hands-on examples by illustration.Each project in the book starts with goals and broad sketches before moving to design and scripting. This helps you understand design intent-the why of the process-rather than just learning the interfaces and the how of it all. Along the way, you'll create Flash content that includes traditional animation techniques (as seen in full-length animated features), and ActionScript-based interactive animation, such as custom web site interface designs. You also learn how to combine both traditional animation techniques and ActionScript to create feature-rich Flash assets from the ground up.Co-authored by educational developers with years of experience creating compelling content, interfaces, and applications, Flash 8: Projects for Learning Animation and Interactivity offers a content-driven approach that is also inspiration-driven. You learn because you're accomplishing something tangible, not because you think you need to know how a tool works.If you want to understand how various features of Flash come together to create a final end design, this book provides you with both the insight and the know-how.

#!This paper examines the role of the general public in informing technology policy, observing that public involvement often occurs only through the electoral process or via feedback after plans have been implemented. Planners and policymakers are not necessarily in touch with the feelings and desires of the public who will be affected by their decisions. For this reason it is important to seek a clearer understanding of the views of citizens who are not typically involved in the planning or design process in order to guide the evolution of technology, as well as to highlight areas where there may be some discrepancy between planners and the needs of everyday users. To broaden the inputs into discussion of emerging problems related to pervasive computing in the State of Hawaii, both information and communication technology specialists (including government policy makers) and members of the general population were invited to participate in a multi-phase study. Differences in perception between specialists and the general public were identified in all phases of research. Specialists were identified as being more focused on near-term issues related to barriers affecting the growth of high-technology industries within the State. Non-specialists showed greater concern for "human" issues, including issues related to the control of technology. Importantly, both groups independently described a need for increased public participation in the process of technological development. Analysis also revealed that both groups found the problem statements generated by non-specialists to be valuable contributions, arguing for their inclusion in the process of problem identification and further supporting the use of participatory planning methods.

#!We present a method for estimating (predicting) parameter values for an agent-based model of in silico hepatocytes (ISH). The method enables the ISH to interact with simulated drugs to reasonably match results from in vitro hepatocyte excretion studies. Further, we make the estimation method available to the model, itself, to enable it to reasonably anticipate (predict) the biliary transport and excretion properties of a new compound based on the acceptable parameter values for previously encountered compounds. We use Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) classification algorithm to determine the degree of similarity between previously tuned compounds and the new compound. Specifically, a set of simulation parameters for enkephalin was predicted using the tuned parameter values of salicylate, taurocholate, and methotrexate. The feature space for the FCM classification is the physicochemical properties of the compounds.

#index8591
#!Motivation: Theoretical efforts to understand the regulation of gene expression are traditionally centered around the identification of transcription factor binding sites at specific DNA positions. More recently these efforts have been supplemented by experimental data for relative binding affinities of proteins to longer intergenic sequences. The question arises to what extent these two approaches converge. In this paper, we adopt a physical binding model to predict the relative binding affinity of a transcription factor for a given sequence. Results: We find that a significant fraction of genome-wide binding data in yeast can be accounted for by simple count matrices and a physical model with only two parameters. We demonstrate that our approach is both conceptually and practically more powerful than traditional methods, which require selection of a cutoff. Our analysis yields biologically meaningful parameters, suitable for predicting relative binding affinities in the absence of experimental binding data.

#!Automatic detection of normal mammograms, as a "first look" for breast cancer, is a new approach to computer-aided diagnosis. This approach may be limited, however, by two main causes. The first problem is the presence of poorly separable "crossed-distributions" in which the correct classification depends upon the value of each feature. The second problem is overlap of the feature distributions that are extracted from digitized mammograms of normal and abnormal patients. Here we introduce a new Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method utilizing with the proposed uncrossing mapping and Local Probability Difference (LPD). Crossed-distribution feature pairs are identified and mapped into a new features that can be separated by a zero-hyperplane of the new axis. The probability density functions of the features of normal and abnormal mammograms are then sampled and the local probability difference functions are estimated to enhance the features. From 1,000 ground-truth-known mammograms, 250 normal and 250 abnormal cases, including spiculated lesions, circumscribed masses or microcalcifications, are used for training a support vector machine. The classification results tested with another 250 normal and 250 abnormal sets show improved testing performances with 90% sensitivity and 89% specificity.

This requirement generally results in unacceptable delays in software development as existing systems are typically unresponsive to required language or code generative changes. NASA/MSFC is attacking the problem of application dependent processor configuration with the MSFC conception and development of the Space Ultrareliable Modular Compuer (SUMC). The SUMC provides for tailored architecture through reconfigurable hardware design and flexible software development via microprogramming. Adaptable system and subsystem processors provide a modular systematic solution for achieving application responsive goals at both the hardware and software levels.

#!The k-nearest-neighbor rule is one of the most attractive pattern classification algorithms. In practice, the choice of k is determined by the cross-validation method. In this work, we propose a new method for neighborhood size selection that is based on the concept of statistical confidence. We define the confidence associated with a decision that is made by the majority rule from a finite number of observations and use it as a criterion to determine the number of nearest neighbors needed. The new algorithm is tested on several real-world datasets and yields results comparable to the k-nearest-neighbor rule. However, in contrast to the k-nearest-neighbor rule that uses a fixed number of nearest neighbors throughout the feature space, our method locally adjusts the number of nearest neighbors until a satisfactory level of confidence is reached. In addition, the statistical confidence provides a natural way to balance the trade-off between the reject rate and the error rate by excluding patterns that have low confidence levels. We believe that this property of our method can be of great importance in applications where the confidence with which a decision is made is equally or more important than the overall error rate.

#index8641
#!Writing robust enterprise applications presents a special challenge for developers, but Microsoft has addressed that challenge with the free, downloadable Enterprise Library for the .NET Framework.Enterprise Library is a collection of application blocks and guidance documents that together provide functionality common to enterprise applications; each application block includes full source code. Lacking in the guidance provided by Microsoft is an overall roadmap to the process of using the application blocks. Effective Use of Microsoft Enterprise Library is that roadmap.Microsoft application development lead architect Len Fenster explains exactly how to build applications using Enterprise Library application blocks. Fenster covers all seven application blocks as implemented for .NET Framework 1.1, shows how to develop and use a new application block, and explains how Enterprise Library is changing for .NET Framework 2.0.Readers will learn How the Configuration Application Block is designed and can be used at runtime to easily read and write configuration data How the Configuration Application Block works at design time for all blocks How to use the Data Access Block to create a portable data layer How to use the Exception Handling Application Block to implement a policy-driven, application-wide exception handling system How to use the Logging and Instrumentation Application Block to log and instrument messages independent of the message destination How to add authentication, authorization, role membership, security cache, and profile membership features to an application with the Security Application Block How to use the Cryptography Application Block to add functionality to encrypt and decrypt data and create and compare hashes How to build your own application block and providers that “snap” right into Enterprise LibraryWhether you plan to extend Enterprise Library for your organization, or just use the existing application blocks to add functionality to your architecture in a consistent, extensible, integrated way, this book will guide you through the complexities and help you find a clear path to success.

#!Virtualization is becoming more and more a key technology enabler to streamline and better operate data centers. In it's simplest form, virtualization refers to the capability of being able to run multiple OS instances, such as Linux® and Windows, on a physical server. Usually the concept of virtualization is associated with high-end servers, such as the IBM System x3950, that are able to support and consolidate multiple heterogeneous software environments. The System x3950 is a highly scalable x86 platform capable of supporting up to 32 processors and 512 GB of memory and is aimed at customers that want to consolidate data centers. Between the server hardware and the operating systems that will run the applications is a virtualization layer of software that manages the entire system. The two main products in this field are VMware ESX Server and Microsoft Virtual Server. This IBM Redbook discusses the technology behind virtualization, x3950 technology, and the two virtualization software products. We also discuss how to manage the solution properly as though they all were a pool of resources with Virtual Machine Manager, a unique and consistent management interface.

#index8699
#!It is known that a super-pseudorandom permutation can be constructed from a pseudorandom function f and two universal hash functions, h and h'. It is a four round Feistel permutation denoted by ψ(hk, f, f, h'k'). In this paper, we show how to re-use the secret key for f in this construction. Specifically, we show that (1) the same key can be used for both h and h', and (2) the key for h and h' can be derived from f. As a result, our construction requires only the key for f as a secret key, and it preserves computational efficiency and security. We show the full security proof of our construction. Also, we derive a similar result for a five round MISTY-type permutation.

#!Researchers are generally trained to administer informed consent by studying approved guidelines, but still can fail to satisfactorily answer questions from potential participants. An application using a virtual character allowed novice participants to practice administering informed consent. This character was designed to behave as a potential participant for a study and asked many of the questions research participants typically ask, such as queries about the study itself, the sponsor, timing, selection procedures, confidentiality, voluntariness, benefits and risks, and contact information. The user responded to the character's queries as if speaking with a true potential research participant. The application was effective even after only brief usage. In a laboratory experiment, novice participants who practiced with the virtual character were later more effective in conducting informed consent interviews with a human interviewee than those who were trained only with written materials. Thus, simulated learning-by-doing improved informed consent skills. Implications for related health dialog applications are discussed.

#!Generalized multilevel constructions for binary RM(r,m) codes using projections onto GF(2 q ) are presented. These constructions exploit component codes over GF(2), GF(4),..., GF(2 q ) that are based on shorter Reed-Muller codes and set partitioning using partition chains of length-2 l codes. Using these constructions we derive multilevel constructions for the Barnes-Wall ¿(r,m) family of lattices which also use component codes over GF(2), GF(4),..., GF(2 q ) and set partitioning based on partition chains of length-2 l lattices. These constructions of Reed-Muller codes and Barnes-Wall lattices are readily applicable for their efficient decoding.

In that paper the watermark information is embedded in the phase of the DFT coefficients. But this kind of PSK based watermarking scheme is very vulnerable to the phase perturbation attack, when some noise is added on the phase of the DFT coefficients, the watermark can't be correctly extracted anymore, while the quality degradation of the attacked watermarked image is visually acceptable.

#index8718
#!Inputting mathematical expressions with a mouse and a keyboard is a troublesome task. Thus, a number of mathematical expression recognition systems capable of recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions to input them into computers have been proposed. Even with these systems, however, structure recognition of mathematical expressions is still difficult. This paper presents MathBox, a new pen-based interface for inputting mathematical expressions into computers. MathBox interactively shows "boxes" in which the user can write one symbol. The boxes are shown along with the user's writing. For example, when the user writes 'x,' the boxes for a power and an index of 'x' and for the next symbol are shown. When the user inputs a fraction line, boxes for the numerator, denominator, and the next symbol are shown. MathBox skips recognizing the structures of expressions, which enables users to write mathematical expressions with practical accuracy.

#!The practical calculation of range bounds for some complex standard functions is addressed in this article. The functions under consideration are root and power functions, the exponential, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and their inverse functions. For such a function f and a given rectangular complex interval z, some interval w is computed that contains all function values of f in z. This is done by expressing the real and the imaginary part of f as compositions of real standard functions and then estimating the ranges of these compositions. In many cases, the inclusions are optimal, such that w is the smallest rectangular interval containing the range of f. The algorithms presented in this article have been implemented in a C&plus;&plus; class library called CoStLy (Complex Standard Functions License), which is distributed under the conditions of the GNU General Public License.

#!Selection of a final design for a new product that is to be introduced in the market is a very critical step in the new product development process. The selection needs to consider three factors of importance: anticipated market demand for the design, designers' preferences, and uncertainty in achieving predicted design attribute levels under different usage conditions and situations. We propose a generalized purchase modeling approach that considers all of the above factors and develop a customer based expected utility metric that forms the basis for a Decision Support System (DSS) for supporting the selection in product design. We illustrate the modeling approach and the use of DSS with the help of a case example that highlights the utility of the proposed DSS.

#!Modern source-level debuggers support dynamic breakpoints that are guarded by conditions based on program state. Such breakpoints address situations where a static breakpoint is not sufficiently precise to characterise a point of interest in program execution. However, we believe that current IDE support for dynamic breakpoints are cumbersome to use. Firstly, guard conditions formulated in (non-aspect-oriented) source-languages cannot directly express control-flow conditions, forcing developers to seek alternative formulations. Secondly, guard-conditions can be complex expressions and manually typing them is cumbersome.We present the Control-flow Breakpoint Debugger (CBD). CBD uses a dynamic pointcut language to characterise control-flow breakpoints---dynamic breakpoints which are conditional on the control-flow through which they were reached. CBD provides a "point-and-click" GUI to specify and incrementally refine control-flow breakpoints, thereby avoiding the burden of manually editing the potentially complex expressions that define them.We performed 20 case studies debugging and fixing documented bugs in 3 existing applications. Our results show that dynamic breakpoints in general are useful in practice, and that CBD's GUI allows specifying them adequately in the majority of cases.

#index8745
#!The present methodology for evaluating complex questions at TREC analyzes answers in terms of facts called "nuggets". The official F-score metric represents the harmonic mean between recall and precision at the nugget level. There is an implicit assumption that some facts are more important than others, which is implemented in a binary split between "vital" and "okay" nuggets. This distinction holds important implications for the TREC scoring model---essentially, systems only receive credit for retrieving vital nuggets---and is a source of evaluation instability. The upshot is that for many questions in the TREC testsets, the median score across all submitted runs is zero. In this work, we introduce a scoring model based on judgments from multiple assessors that captures a more refined notion of nugget importance. We demonstrate on TREC 2003, 2004, and 2005 data that our "nugget pyramids" address many shortcomings of the present methodology, while introducing only minimal additional overhead on the evaluation flow.

#!Interest for machine learning techniques has increased over the last decade. In spite of this the application practice of these techniques has never been systematically analysed. This paper analyses the practical application of Inductive Learning Techniques in the Netherlands by means of a survey. Results of this survey are assessed in terms of introduction of (information) technological innovation. The application practice for these techniques finds itself in an initial stage. Current practice is dominated by technical issues and there is little attention for methodological issues associated with analysis of the problem and data collection. In the paper we propose a four level model for describing the methodological aspects of ILT application. The current practice of application concentrates on the two lowermost layers. Tools for developing applications concentrate mainly on the lowest, technical level.

#!Many small online communities would benefit from increased diversity or activity in their membership. Some communities run the risk of dying out due to lack of participation. Others struggle to achieve the critical mass necessary for diverse and engaging conversation. But what tools are available to these communities to increase participation? Our goal in this research was to spark contributions to the movielens.org discussion forum, where only 2% of the members write posts. We developed personalized invitations, messages designed to entice users to visit or contribute to the forum. In two field experiments, we ask (1) if personalized invitations increase activity in a discussion forum, (2) how the choice of algorithm for intelligently choosing content to emphasize in the invitation affects participation, and (3) how the suggestion made to the user affects their willingness to act. We find that invitations lead to increased participation, as measured by levels of reading and posting. More surprisingly, we find that invitations emphasizing the social nature of the discussion forum increase user activity, while invitations emphasizing other details of the discussion are less successful.

#!Techniques of noise detection have been widely applied in impulse noise reduction. However, the phenomenon of pixel misclassification is very obvious in high noise density. In order to improve pixel identification, in this paper, the new noise detector is proposed. Based on solutions of equations, an estimated block of every 8x8 block of a noise image is generated. Then, according to relationships between these noise blocks and their estimated blocks, corrupted and uncorrupted pixels are identified. During image filtering, a noise-detection-based adaptive median algorithm is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed filter can well reduce the impulse noise and preserve more details of original images.

#!We present a deformable registration algorithm for multi-modality images based on information theoretic similarity measures at the scale of individual image voxels. We derive analytical expressions for the mutual information, the joint entropy, and the sum of marginal entropies of two images over a small neighborhood in terms of image gradients. Using these expressions, we formulate image registration algorithms maximizing local similarity over the whole image domain in an energy minimization framework. This strategy produces highly elastic image alignment as the registration is driven by voxel similarities between the images, the algorithms are easily implementable using the closed-form expressions for the derivative of the optimization function with respect to the deformation, and avoid estimation of joint and marginal probability densities governing the image intensities essential to conventional information theoretic image registration methods.

#*Inpainting Highlights Using Color Line Projection
#@Joung Wook Park,Kwan Heng Lee
#t2007
#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index8802
#!In this paper we propose a novel method to inpaint highlights and to remove the specularity in the image with specular objects by the color line projection. Color line projection is the method that a color with a surface reflection component is projected near the diffuse color line by following the direction of the specular color line. We use two captured images using different exposure time so that the clue of the original color in a highlight area is searched from two images since the color at the highlight region is distorted and saturated to the illumination color. In the first step of the proposed procedure, the region corresponding to the highlight is generated and the clue of the original highlight color is acquired. In the next step, the color line is generated by the restricted region growing method around the highlight region, and the color line is divided into the diffuse color line and the specular color line. In the final step, pixels near the specular color line are projected onto near the diffuse color line by the color line projection, in which the modified random function is applied to realistically inpaint the highlight. One of advantages in our method is to find the highlight region and the clue of the original color of the highlight with ease. It also efficiently estimates the surface reflection component which is utilized to remove specularity and to inpaint the highlight. The proposed method performs the highlight inpainting and the specular removal simultaneously once the color line is generated. In addition, color line projection with the modified random function can make the result more realistic. We show experimental results from the real images and make a synthesis of the real image and the image modified by the proposed method.

#!As silicon technologies move into the nanometer regime, transistor reliability is expected to wane as devices become subject to extreme process variation, particle-induced transient errors, and transistor wear-out. Unless these challenges are addressed, computer vendors can expect low yields and short mean-times-to-failure. In this article, we examine the challenges of designing complex computing systems in the presence of transient and permanent faults. We select one small aspect of a typical chip multiprocessor (CMP) system to study in detail, a single CMP router switch. Our goal is to design a BulletProof CMP switch architecture capable of tolerating significant levels of various types of defects. We first assess the vulnerability of the CMP switch to transient faults. To better understand the impact of these faults, we evaluate our CMP switch designs using circuit-level timing on detailed physical layouts. Our infrastructure represents a new level of fidelity in architectural-level fault analysis, as we can accurately track faults as they occur, noting whether they manifest or not, because of masking in the circuits, logic, or architecture. Our experimental results are quite illuminating. We find that transient faults, because of their fleeting nature, are of little concern for our CMP switch, even within large switch fabrics with fast clocks. Next, we develop a unified model of permanent faults, based on the time-tested bathtub curve. Using this convenient abstraction, we analyze the reliability versus area tradeoff across a wide spectrum of CMP switch designs, ranging from unprotected designs to fully protected designs with on-line repair and recovery capabilities. Protection is considered at multiple levels from the entire system down through arbitrary partitions of the design. We find that designs are attainable that can tolerate a larger number of defects with less overhead than na&iuml;ve triple-modular redundancy, using domain-specific techniques, such as end-to-end error detection, resource sparing, automatic circuit decomposition, and iterative diagnosis and reconfiguration.

#!This paper describes an improved boosting algorithm, the MutualBoost algorithm, and its application in developing a fast and robust Gabor feature based face recognition system. The algorithm uses mutual information to eliminate redundancy among Gabor features selected using the AdaBoost algorithm. Selected Gabor features are then subjected to Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) for class separability enhancement before being used for face recognition. Compared with one of the top performers in the 2004 face verification competition, our method demonstrates clear advantages in classification accuracy, memory and computation. The method has been tested on the whole FERET database using the FERET evaluation protocol. Significant improvement in performance is observed. For example, existing Gabor based methods use a huge number of Gabor features, our method needs only hundreds of Gabor features to achieve very high classification accuracy. Due to substantially reduced feature dimension, memory and computation costs are reduced significantly - only 4s are needed to recognize 200 face images.

#!This paper presents a hierarchical pattern matching and generalisation technique which is applied to the problem of locating the correct speaker of quoted speech found in fiction books. Patterns from a training set are generalised to create a small number of rules, which can be used to identify items of interest within the text. The pattern matching technique is applied to finding the Speech-Verb, Actor and Speaker of quotes found in fiction books. The technique performs well over the training data, resulting in rule-sets many times smaller than the training set, but providing very high accuracy. While the rule-set generalised from one book is less effective when applied to different books than an approach based on hand coded heuristics, performance is comparable when testing on data closely related to the training set.

#!Using service-related functions on the HMC Planning and implementing a secure network Exploiting HMC commands The IBM Hardware Management Console for pSeries (HMC) is a tool used for administration and management of IBM eServer pSeries servers. It was first announced in late 2001 with the IBM eServer pSeries 690 Model 681, the first partitioning-capable pSeries server model, and has been supporting the other partitioning-capable pSeries server models in conjunction with several software release level updates. The major function provided by the HMC is partitioning management, which is well covered well by several other publications. This IBM Redbook, designed to be used as a deskside reference for systems administrators who manage partitioning-capable pSeries servers using the HMC, is meant to complement these other publications by covering the following topics: - Configuring the HMC - Managing software levels on the HMC - Secure remote GUI access to the HMC - Secure networking in a partitioned environment - Service functions on the HMC In addition, this book covers the basic usage of the HMC graphical user interface. New HMC commands, available with the HMC software Release 3, Version 2, are detailed in Chapter 9, HMC command line interface and Chapter 10, Advanced HMC command examples.

#!Service prioritization among different traffic classes is an important goal for the Internet. Conventional approaches to solving this problem consider the existing best-effort class as the low-priority class, and attempt to develop mechanisms that provide "better-than-best-effort" service. In this paper, we explore the opposite approach, and devise a new distributed algorithm to realize a low-priority service (as compared to the existing best effort) from the network endpoints. To this end, we develop TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP), a distributed algorithm whose goal is to utilize only the excess network bandwidth as compared to the "fair share" of bandwidth as targeted by TCP. The key mechanisms unique to TCP-LP congestion control are the use of one-way packet delays for early congestion indications and a TCP-transparent congestion avoidance policy. The results of our simulation and Internet experiments show that: 1) TCP-LP is largely non-intrusive to TCP traffic; 2) both single and aggregate TCP-LP flows are able to successfully utilize excess network bandwidth; moreover, multiple TCP-LP flows share excess bandwidth fairly; 3) substantial amounts of excess bandwidth are available to the low-priority class, even in the presence of "greedy" TCP flows; 4) the response times of web connections in the best-effort class decrease by up to 90% when long-lived bulk data transfers use TCP-LP rather than TCP; 5) despite their low-priority nature, TCP-LP flows are able to utilize significant amounts of available bandwidth in a wide-area network environment.

#!Many software attacks are based on injecting malicious code into a target host. This paper demonstrates the use of a well-known technique, data tainting, to track data received from the network as it propagates through a system and to prevent its execution. Unlike past approaches to taint tracking, which track tainted data by running the system completely in an emulator or simulator, resulting in considerable execution overhead, our work demonstrates the ability to dynamically switch a running system between virtualized and emulated execution. Using this technique, we are able to explore hardware support for taint-based protection that is deployable in real-world situations, as emulation is only used when tainted data is being processed by the CPU. By modifying the CPU, memory, and I/O devices to support taint tracking and protection, we guarantee that data received from the network may not be executed, even if it is written to, and later read from disk. We demonstrate near native speeds for workloads where little taint data is present.

#!Even in the current computer age, there are still many important application areas, such as early architectural design, where traditional tools like sketching on paper continue to be preferred by many professionals over computer-based tools. There is a growing awareness that there are often very good grounds for this preference. Hence, instead of trying to replace such traditional ways of working, it is now often considered more opportune to try and preserve the strengths of these traditional ways of working, while at the same time improving them by providing access to new media. This is one of the main objectives of the augmented reality approach that we adopt here. In this paper, we specifically discuss the realization of a tool for early architectural design on an existing augmented reality system, called the Visual Interaction Platform. We describe the development process, the resulting tool and its performance for elementary tasks such as positioning and overdrawing. We also identify directions for future research and applications.

#!This paper discusses potential techniques for the dynamic generation of instructions in the instruction fetch unit of a processor. The chief advantage is the increased effective bandwidth in transfer of compressed program information from memory to the processor unit, which allows higher processor speed for a given memory access rate. The method is independent of cache memory techniques, although aimed at the same problem, and could be combined with use of a cache memory to obtain still more speedup of processor execution. The paper is largely at a conceptual level; work is planned to obtain data to facilitate design and simulation of a prototype machine.

#!Beowulf clusters have become very popular as an alternative to supercomputers world-wide. However, the most pressing issues of today's cluster solutions is the need for high availability and performance. Such systems, clearly, are prone to break-downs. Even if cover is provided with some probability c, there will be reconfiguration and/or rebooting delays to resume the operation of a cluster. In this paper, the performance modelling for Beowulf multiprocessor systems is presented. For these systems, one head processor and several identical processors serving a common stream of arriving jobs is considered. To account for delays due to reconfiguration and rebooting, such systems are modelled and solved for exact performability measures, for both bounded and unbounded queuing capacities, using the spectral expansion method.

In The Myths of Innovation, bestselling author Scott Berkun takes a careful look at innovation history, including the software and Internet Age, to reveal how ideas truly become successful innovations-truths that people can apply to today's challenges. Using dozens of examples from the history of technology, business, and the arts, you'll learn how to convert the knowledge you have into ideas that can change the world. Why all innovation is a collaborative processHow innovation depends on persuasionWhy problems are more important than solutionsHow the good innovation is the enemy of the greatWhy the biggest challenge is knowing when it's good enough "For centuries before Google, MIT, and IDEO, modern hotbeds of innovation, we struggled to explain any kind of creation, from the universe itself to the multitudes of ideas around us. While we can make atomic bombs, and dry-clean silk ties, we still don't have satisfying answers for simple questions like: Where do songs come from? Are there an infinite variety of possible kinds of cheese? How did Shakespeare and Stephen King invent so much, while we're satisfied watching sitcom reruns? Our popular answers have been unconvincing, enabling misleading, fantasy-laden myths to grow strong." -- Scott Berkun, from the text. "Insightful, inspiring, evocative, and just plain fun to read it's totally great." -- John Seely Brown, former Chief Scientist of Xerox, and Director, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC); current Chief of Confusion "Small, simple, powerful: an innovative book about innovation." -- Don Norman, Nielsen Norman Group, Northwestern University; author of Emotional Design and Design of Everyday Things "The naked truth about innovation is ugly, funny, and eye-opening, but it sure isn't what most of us have come to believe. With this book, Berkun sets us free to try to change the world unencumbered with misconceptions about how innovation happens." -- Guy Kawasaki, author of The Art of the Start "Brimming with insights and historical examples, Berkun's book not only debunks widely held myths about innovation but also points the ways toward making your new ideas stick. Even in today's ultra-busy commercial world, reading this book will be time well spent." -- Tom Kelley, GM, IDEO; author of The Ten Faces of Innovation "This book cuts through the hype, analyzes what is essential, and more importantly, what is not. You will leave with a thorough understanding of what really drives innovation." -- Werner Vogels, CTO, Amazon.com "I loved this book. It's an easy-to-read playbook for anyone wanting to lead and manage positive change in their business." -- Frank McDermott, Marketing Manager, EMI Music Scott Berkun knows innovation. A member of the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft from 1994-1999, he is a full-time author at www.scottberkun.com and wrote the 2005 bestseller, The Art of Project Management (O'Reilly).

#!Embedded computer systems literally surround us: they're in our cell phones, PDAs, cars, TVs, refrigerators, heating systems, and more. In fact, embedded systems are one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer industry today. Along with the growing list of devices for which embedded computer systems are appropriate, interest is growing among programmers, hobbyists, and engineers of all types in how to design and build devices of their own. Furthermore, the knowledge offered by this book into the fundamentals of these computer systems can benefit anyone who has to evaluate and apply the systems. The second edition of Designing Embedded Hardware has been updated to include information on the latest generation of processors and microcontrollers, including the new MAXQ processor. If you're new to this and don't know what a MAXQ is, don't worry--the book spells out the basics of embedded design for beginners while providing material useful for advanced systems designers. Designing Embedded Hardware steers a course between those books dedicated to writing code for particular microprocessors, and those that stress the philosophy of embedded system design without providing any practical information. Having designed 40 embedded computer systems of his own, author John Catsoulis brings a wealth of real-world experience to show readers how to design and create entirely new embedded devices and computerized gadgets, as well as how to customize and extend off-the-shelf systems. Loaded with real examples, this book also provides a roadmap to the pitfalls and traps to avoid. Designing Embedded Hardware includes: The theory and practice of embedded systems Understanding schematics and data sheets Powering an embedded system Producing and debugging an embedded system Processors such as the PIC, Atmel AVR, and Motorola 68000-series Digital Signal Processing (DSP) architectures Protocols (SPI and I2C) used to add peripherals RS-232C, RS-422, infrared communication, and USB CAN and Ethernet networking Pulse Width Monitoring and motor control If you want to build your own embedded system, or tweak an existing one, this invaluable book gives you the understanding and practical skills you need.

#!In this paper we present Damon, a decentralized wide-area runtime aspect middleware built on top of a structured peer-to-peer (p2p) substrate and a dynamic Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) framework. By using this methodology, we provide innovative benefits like aspect persistence and discovery, a high performance one-to-one/one-to-many messaging system, reflective skills, and a decentralized aspect container. Furthermore, new pointcut abstractions (anypointcut, manypointcut and multipointcut) are introduced, which allow development of shared aspect functionalities in a transparent way. We believe that such middleware is a novel solution for allowing decentralized crosscutting concerns like fault-tolerance or load-balancing for distributed systems. This paper describes these ideas and it presents a use case of our middleware implementation.

#!Boundary representation models reverse engineered from 3D range data suffer from various inaccuracies caused by noise in the measured data and the model building software. Beautification aims to improve such models in a post-processing step solely working with the boundary representation model. The improved model should exhibit topological and geometric regularities representing the original, ideal design intent. This paper gives an overview of algorithms for a complete beautification system suitable for improving the topology and the geometry of low to medium complexity reverse engineered models.

#index8897
#!For most security planners, a key challenge is to continuously evaluate how changes or additions to their facilities or procedures impact security effectiveness, operational costs, and passenger throughput. Each change must be analyzed to ensure negative effects do not outweigh the benefits. This paper presents Security Checkpoint Optimizer (SCO), a 2-D spatially aware discrete event simulation tool developed by Northrop Grumman for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. SCO is designed to allow security analysts to graphically build a simulation model and layout a series of screening activities to take place. Once the model is defined, SCO simulates passenger movement using both path-based and pathless movement algorithms to mimic a semi-autonomous passenger traversal of a 2-D space. The software is designed to allow analysts to perform multiple "what-if" analyses to balance benefits and tradeoffs.

#*Free Iris and Focus Image Generation by Merging Multiple Differently Focused Images Based on a Three-Dimensional Filtering
#@Kazuya Kodama,Akira Kubota
#t2007
#cIEICE - Transactions on Information and Systems
#index8899
#!This paper describes a method of free iris and focus image generation based on transformation integrating multiple differently focused images. First, we assume that objects are defocused by a geometrical blurring model. And we combine acquired images on certain imaging planes and spatial information of objects by using a convolution of a three-dimensional blur. Then, based on spatial frequency analysis of the blur, we design three-dimensional filters that generate free iris and focus images from the acquired images. The method enables us to generate not only an all-in-focus image corresponding to an ideal pin-hole iris but also various images, which would be acquired with virtual irises whose sizes are different from the original one. In order to generate a certain image by using multiple differently focused images, especially very many images, conventional methods usually analyze focused regions of each acquired image independently and construct a depth map. Then, based on the map, the regions are merged into a desired image with some effects. However, generally, it is so difficult to conduct such depth estimation robustly in all regions that these methods cannot prevent merged results from including visible artifacts, which decrease the quality of generated images awfully. In this paper, we propose a method of generating desired images directly and robustly from very many differently focused images without depth estimation. Simulations of image generation are performed utilizing synthetic images to study how certain parameters of the blur and the filter affect the quality of generated images. We also introduce pre-processing that corrects the size of acquired images and a simple method for estimating the parameter of the three-dimensional blur. Finally, we show experimental results of free iris and focus image generation from real images.

#!Learning-based super-resolution has recently been proposed for enhancing human face images, known as ''face hallucination''. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to super-resolve face images given multiple partially occluded inputs at different lower resolutions. By integrating hierarchical patch-wise alignment and inter-frame constraints into a Bayesian framework, we can probabilistically align multiple input images at different resolutions and recursively infer the high-resolution face image. We address the problem of fusing partial imagery information through multiple frames and discuss the new algorithm's effectiveness when encountering occluded low-resolution face images. We show promising results compared to those of existing face hallucination methods from both simulated facial database and live video sequences.

#!In this paper, we discuss some equivalences between two recently introduced statistical learning schemes, namely Mercer kernel methods and information theoretic methods. We show that Parzen window-based estimators for some information theoretic cost functions are also cost functions in a corresponding Mercer kernel space. The Mercer kernel is directly related to the Parzen window. Furthermore, we analyze a classification rule based on an information theoretic criterion, and show that this corresponds to a linear classifier in the kernel space. By introducing a weighted Parzen window density estimator, we also formulate the support vector machine in this information theoretic perspective.

#!Zernike moments which are superior to geometric moments because of their special properties of image reconstruction and immunity to noise, suffer from several discretization errors. These errors lead to poor quality of reconstructed image and wide variations in the numerical values of the moments. The predominant factor, as observed in this paper, is due to the discrete integer implementation of the steps involved in moment calculation. It is shown in this paper that by modifying the algorithms to include discrete float implementation, the quality of the reconstructed image improves significantly and the first-order moment becomes zero. Low-order Zernike moments have been found to be stable under linear transformations while the high-order moments have large variations. The large variations in high-order moments, however, do not greatly affect the quality of the reconstructed image, implying that they should be ignored when numerical values of moments are used as features. The 11 functions based on geometric moments have also been found to be stable under linear transformations and thus these can be used as features. Pixel level analysis of the images has been carried out to strengthen the results.

#*QOMA: quasi-optimal multiple alignment of protein sequences

#t2007
#cBioinformatics
#index8914
#!Motivation: We consider the problem of multiple alignment of protein sequences with the goal of achieving a large SP (Sum-of-Pairs) score. Results: We introduce a new graph-based method. We name our method QOMA (Quasi-Optimal Multiple Alignment). QOMA starts with an initial alignment. It represents this alignment using a K-partite graph. It then improves the SP score of the initial alignment through local optimizations within a window that moves greedily on the alignment. QOMA uses two parameters to permit flexibility in time/accuracy trade off: (1) The size of the window for local optimization. (2) The sparsity of the K-partite graph. Unlike traditional progressive methods, QOMA is independent of the order of sequences. The experimental results on BAliBASE benchmarks show that QOMA produces higher SP score than the existing tools including ClustalW, Probcons, Muscle, T-Coffee and DCA. The difference is more significant for distant proteins. Availability: The software is available from the authors upon request.

#!This paper presents a robust method for tracing intersection curve segments between continuous rational parametric surfaces, typically rational polynomial parametric surface patches. The tracing procedure is based on a validated ordinary differential equation (ODE) system solver which can be applied, without substantial overhead, for transversal as well as tangential intersections. Application of the validated ODE solver in the context of eliminating the phenomenon of straying and looping is discussed. In addition, we develop a method to fulfill the condition of a continuous gap-free boundary with a definite numerically verified upper bound for the intersection curve error in parameter space and is further mapped to an upper bound for the intersection curve error in 3D model space, which assists in defining well-formed boundary representation models of complex 3D solids.

#!In a typical organization, there's always plenty that to do such as: pay vendors, invoice customers, answer customer inquiries, and fix bugs in hardware or software. You need to know who wants what and keep track of what is left to do. This is where a ticketing system comes in. A ticketing system allows you to check the status of various tasks: when they were requested, who requested them and why, when they were completed, and more. RT is a high-level, open source ticketing system efficiently enabling a group of people to manage tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users.RT Essentials, co-written by one of the RT's original core developers, Jesse Vincent, starts off with a quick background lesson about ticketing systems and then shows you how to install and configure RT. This comprehensive guide explains how to perform day-to-day tasks to turn your RT server into a highly useful tracking tool. One way it does this is by examining how a company could use RT to manage its internal processes. Advanced chapters focus on developing add-on tools and utilities using Perl and Mason. There's also chapter filled with suggested uses for RT inside your organization.No matter what kind of data your organization tracks--from sales inquiries to security incidents or anything in between--RT Essentials helps you use RT to provide order when you need it most.

#!In order to overcome some unavoidable factors, like shift of the part, that influence the crisp neural networks' recognition, the present study is dedicated in developing a novel fuzzy neural network (FNN), which integrates both the fuzzy set theory and adaptive resonance theory 2 (ART2) neural network for grouping the parts into several families based on the image captured from the Vision sensor. The proposed network posses the fuzzy inputs as well as the fuzzy weights. The model evaluation results showed that the proposed fuzzy neural network is able to provide more accurate results compared to the fuzzy self-organizing feature maps (SOM) neural network [R.J. Kuo, S.S. Chi, P.W. Teng, Generalized part family formation through fuzzy self-organizing feature map neural network, International Journal of Computers in Industrial Engineering, 40 (2001b) 79-100] and fuzzy c-means algorithm.

#%164845
#!In the field of proteomics, protein hierarchies based on sequence analysis have been extensively applied to automate the annotations of new proteins and facilitate the discovery and analysis of protein families. However, the presence of ambiguous similarities in large databases increases the difficulty of delivering protein family hierarchies with favorable sensitivity and specificity. This work develops the HomoClust algorithm that exploits the homogeneity of protein sequences in generating protein family hierarchies. HomoClust improves the clustering quality of traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms by adopting different clustering mechanisms for different levels of sequence similarity. With considering homogeneity detection during clustering process, HomoClust increases the sensitivity of protein clusters without a drop in high specificity.

#!The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator was developed by Yager [IEEE Trans. Syst., Man, Cybernet. 18 (1998) 183]. Later, Yager and Filev [IEEE Trans. Syst., Man, Cybernet.--Part B 29 (1999) 141] introduced a more general class of OWA operators called the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operators, which take as their argument pairs, called OWA pairs, in which one component is used to induce an ordering over the second components which are exact numerical values and then aggregated. The aim of this paper is to develop some induced uncertain linguistic OWA (IULOWA) operators, in which the second components are uncertain linguistic variables. Some desirable properties of the IULOWA operators are studied, and then, the IULOWA operators are applied to group decision making with uncertain linguistic information.

#!Dyson's celebrated constant term conjecture [F.J. Dyson, Statistical theory of the energy levels of complex systems I, J. Math. Phys. 3 (1962) 140-156] states that the constant term in the expansion of Π1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ n(1 - xi/xj)aj is the multinomial coefficient (a1 + a2 + ... + an)!/(a1!a2! ... an!). The definitive proof was given by I.J. Good [I.J. Good, Short proof of a conjecture of Dyson, J. Math. Phys. 11 (1970) 1884]. Later, Andrews extended Dyson's conjecture to a q-analog [G.E. Andrews, Problems and prospects for basic hypergeometric functions, in: R. Askey (Ed.), The Theory and Application of Special Functions, Academic Press, New York, 1975, pp. 191-224]. In this paper, closed form expressions are given for the coefficients of several other terms in the Dyson product, and are proved using an extension of Good's idea. Also, conjectures for the corresponding q-analogs are supplied. Finally, perturbed versions of the q-Dixon summation formula are presented.

#index8991
#!This book is about writing software that makes the most effective use of the system you're running on -- code that interfaces directly with the kernel and core system libraries, including the shell, text editor, compiler, debugger, core utilities, and system daemons. The majority of both Unix and Linux code is still written at the system level, and Linux System Programming focuses on everything above the kernel, where applications such as Apache, bash, cp, vim, Emacs, gcc, gdb, glibc, ls, mv, and X exist. Written primarily for engineers looking to program (better) at the low level, this book is an ideal teaching tool for any programmer. Even with the trend toward high-level development, either through web software (such as PHP) or managed code (C#), someone still has to write the PHP interpreter and the C# virtual machine. Linux System Programming gives you an understanding of core internals that makes for better code, no matter where it appears in the stack. Debugging high-level code often requires you to understand the system calls and kernel behavior of your operating system, too. Key topics include: An overview of Linux, the kernel, the C library, and the C compilerReading from and writing to files, along with other basic file I/O operations, including how the Linux kernel implements and manages file I/OBuffer size management, including the Standard I/O libraryAdvanced I/O interfaces, memory mappings, and optimization techniquesThe family of system calls for basic process managementAdvanced process management, including real-time processesFile and directories-creating, moving, copying, deleting, and managing themMemory management -- interfaces for allocating memory, managing the memory you have, and optimizing your memory accessSignals and their role on a Unix system, plus basic and advanced signal interfacesTime, sleeping, and clock management, starting with the basics and continuing through POSIX clocks and high resolution timers With Linux System Programming, you will be able to take an in-depth look at Linux from both a theoretical and an applied perspective as you cover a wide range of programming topics.

Perhaps part of the problem associated with the use of encryption software that limits its use is the need to remember a series of additional passwords and the consequence associated with forgetting these passwords. Fortunately, the proliferation of USB storage devices enables software developers to use this near-ubiquitous hardware device to facilitate software operations. One such product that employs a USB storage device to facilitate the encryption of data is DESlock+, a feature-rich Windows data encryption utility program from Data Encryption Systems Ltd. of Somerset, UK, which is the focus of this column.

#!This paper integrates Nelder-Mead simplex search method (NM) with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), respectively, in an attempt to locate the global optimal solutions for the nonlinear continuous variable functions mainly focusing on response surface methodology (RSM). Both the hybrid NM-GA and NM-PSO algorithms incorporate concepts from the NM, GA or PSO, which are readily to implement in practice and the computation of functional derivatives is not necessary. The hybrid methods were first illustrated through four test functions from the RSM literature and were compared with original NM, GA and PSO algorithms. In each test scheme, the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of these methods were evaluated via associated performance statistics, and the proposed hybrid approaches prove to be very suitable for solving the optimization problems of RSM-type. The hybrid methods were then tested by ten difficult nonlinear continuous functions and were compared with the best known heuristics in the literature. The results show that both hybrid algorithms were able to reach the global optimum in all runs within a comparably computational expense.

#!Work on photometric stereo has shown how to recover the shape and reflectance properties of an object using multiple images taken with a fixed viewpoint and variable lighting conditions. This work has primarily relied on known lighting conditions or the presence of a single point source of light in each image. In this paper we show how to perform photometric stereo assuming that all lights in a scene are distant from the object but otherwise unconstrained. Lighting in each image may be an unknown and may include arbitrary combination of diffuse, point and extended sources. Our work is based on recent results showing that for Lambertian objects, general lighting conditions can be represented using low order spherical harmonics. Using this representation we can recover shape by performing a simple optimization in a low-dimensional space. We also analyze the shape ambiguities that arise in such a representation. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing the shape of objects from images obtained under a variety of lightings. We further compare the reconstructed shapes against shapes obtained with a laser scanner.

#!Many computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms are very sensitive to the choice of an appropriate distance metric. Some recent research sought to address a variant of the conventional clustering problem called semi-supervised clustering, which performs clustering in the presence of some background knowledge or supervisory information expressed as pairwise similarity or dissimilarity constraints. However, existing metric learning methods for semi-supervised clustering mostly perform global metric learning through a linear transformation. In this paper, we propose a new metric learning method that performs nonlinear transformation globally but linear transformation locally. In particular, we formulate the learning problem as an optimization problem and present three methods for solving it. Through some toy data sets, we show empirically that our locally linear metric adaptation (LLMA) method can handle some difficult cases that cannot be handled satisfactorily by previous methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on some UCI data sets. Besides applying LLMA to semi-supervised clustering, we have also used it to improve the performance of content-based image retrieval systems through metric learning. Experimental results based on two real-world image databases show that LLMA significantly outperforms other methods in boosting the image retrieval performance.

Here we show that these angles may often be described in terms of the "norms" of certain nonlinear operators, and hence obtain an alternate way of computing this rate of convergence.

However, figuring out how to tell it interactively-and in a way that keeps your audience coming back for more-can be challenging. Here to help you out (and to open your mind to ever more creative ways of producing those stories) is the man who created the cult publication The Art of Computer Game Design and who has devoted much of his career to that very topic: Chris Crawford. To highlight the path for future gains in the quest for a truly interactive story, Chris provides a solid sampling of what doesn't work, contrasting unsuccessful methodologies with those that hold promise for the future. Throughout you'll find examples of contemporary games that rely on different technologies-and learn the storytelling lessons to be garnered from each of the past methodologies. Within the context of interactive storytelling, Chris explores ways of providing conflict and challenge, the difference between low- and high-interactivity designs, the necessity to move beyond purely visual thinking (so that the player is engaged on multiple levels), and more.

The scaling of the accelerated algorithms are verified by test runs performed on a one-dimensional model. Both performance and accuracy are evaluated. One to two orders of magnitude increases of efficiency are achieved while preserving physical accuracy.

#cProceedings of the main conference on Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics
#index9036
#!Recent work on semantic role labeling (SRL) has focused almost exclusively on the analysis of the predicate-argument structure of verbs, largely due to the lack of human-annotated resources for other types of predicates that can serve as training and test data for the semantic role labeling systems. However, it is well-known that verbs are not the only type of predicates that can take arguments. Most notably, nouns that are nominalized forms of verbs and relational nouns generally are also considered to have their own predicate-argument structure. In this paper we report results of SRL experiments on nominalized predicates in Chinese, using a newly completed corpus, the Chinese Nombank. We also discuss the impact of using publicly available manually annotated verb data to improve the SRL accuracy of nouns, exploiting a widely-held assumption that verbs and their nominalizations share the same predicate-argument structure. Finally, we discuss the results of applying reranking techniques to improve SRL accuracy for nominalized predicates, which showed insignificant improvement.

#!Conventional performance evaluation mechanisms focus on dedicated systems. Grid computing infrastructure, on the other hand, is a shared collaborative environment constructed on virtual organizations. Each organization has its own resource management policy and usage pattern. The non-dedicated characteristic of Grid computing prevents the leverage of conventional performance evaluation systems. In this study, we introduce the grid harvest service (GHS) performance evaluation and task scheduling system for solving large-scale applications in a shared environment. GHS is based on a novel performance prediction model and a set of task scheduling algorithms. GHS supports three classes of task scheduling, single task, parallel processing and meta-task. Experimental results show that GHS provides a satisfactory solution for performance prediction and task scheduling of large applications and has a real potential.

#!Wireless sensor networks consist of a system of distributed sensors embedded in the physical world, and promise to allow observation of previously unobservable phenomena. Since they are exposed to unpredictable environments, sensor-network applications must handle a wide variety of faults: software errors, node and link failures, and network partitions. The code to manually detect and recover from faults crosscuts the entire application, is tedious to implement correctly and efficiently, and is fragile in the face of program modifications. We investigate language support for modularly managing faults. Our insight is that such support can be naturally provided as an extension to existing "macroprogramming" systems for sensor networks. In such a system, a programmer describes a sensor network application as a centralized program; a compiler then produces equivalent node-level programs. We describe a simple checkpoint API for macroprograms, which can be automatically implemented in a distributed fashion across the network. We also describe declarative annotations that allow programmers to specify checkpointing strategies at a higher level of abstraction. We have implemented our approach in the Kairos macroprogramming system. Experiments show it to improve application availability by an order of magnitude and incur low messaging overhead.

#!Automatic biometric systems based on human characteristics for personal identification have attracted great attention. Their performance highly depends on the distinctive information in the biometrics. Identical twins having the closest genetics-based relationship are expected to have maximum similarity in their biometrics. Classifying identical twins is a challenging problem for some automatic biometric systems. Palmprint has been studied for personal identification for over seven years. Most of the previous research concentrates on algorithm development. In this paper, we systemically examine palmprints from the same DNA for automatic personal identification and to uncover the genetically related palmprint features. The experimental results show that the three principal lines and some portions of weak lines are genetically related features but our palms still contain rich genetically unrelated features for classifying identical twins.

#!Consisting of a number of well-known open source products, JBoss is more a family of interrelated services than a single monolithic application. But, as with any tool that's as feature-rich as JBoss, there are number of pitfalls and complexities, too. Most developers struggle with the same issues when deploying J2EE applications on JBoss: they have trouble getting the many J2EE and JBoss deployment descriptors to work together; they have difficulty finding out how to get started; their projects don't have a packaging and deployment strategy that grows with the application; or, they find the Class Loaders confusing and don't know how to use them, which can cause problems.JBoss at Work: A Practical Guide helps developers overcome these challenges. As you work through the book, you'll build a project using extensive code examples. You'll delve into all the major facets of J2EE application deployment on JBoss, including JSPs, Servlets, EJBs, JMS, JNDI, web services, JavaMail, JDBC, and Hibernate. With the help of this book, you'll:Implement a full J2EE application and deploy it on JBossDiscover how to use the latest features of JBoss 4 and J2EE 1.4, including J2EE-compliant web servicesMaster J2EE application deployment on JBoss with EARs, WARs, and EJB JARsUnderstand the core J2EE deployment descriptors and how they integrate with JBoss-specific descriptorsBase your security strategy on JAASWritten for Java developers who want to use JBoss on their projects, the book covers the gamut of deploying J2EE technologies on JBoss, providing a brief survey of each subject aimed at the working professional with limited time.If you're one of the legions of developers who have decided to give JBoss a try, then JBoss at Work: A Practical Guide is your next logical purchase. It'll show you in plain language how to use the fastest growing open source tool in the industry today. If you've worked with JBoss before, this book will get you up to speed on JBoss 4, JBoss WS (web services), and Hibernate 3.

#!It is generally recognized that conceptual modeling is one of the most vital parts of a simulation study. At the same time, it also seems to be one of the least understood. A review of the extant literature on conceptual modeling reveals a range of issues that need to be addressed: the definition of conceptual model(ling), conceptual model requirements, how to develop a conceptual model, conceptual model representation and communication, conceptual model validation, and teaching conceptual modeling. It is clear that this is an area ripe for further research, for the clarification of ideas and the development of new approaches. Some areas in which further research could be carried out are identified.

#!The restarting automaton is a restricted model of computation that was introduced by Jančar et al. to model the so-called analysis by reduction, which is a technique used in linguistics to analyse sentences of natural languages. The most general models of restarting automata make use of auxiliary symbols in their rewrite operations, although this ability does not directly correspond to any aspect of the analysis by reduction. Here we put restrictions on the way in which restarting automata use auxiliary symbols, and we investigate the influence of these restrictions on their expressive power. In fact, we consider two types of restrictions. First, we consider the number of auxiliary symbols in the tape alphabet of a restarting automaton as a measure of its descriptional complexity. Secondly, we consider the number of occurrences of auxiliary symbols on the tape as a dynamic complexity measure. We establish some lower and upper bounds with respect to these complexity measures concerning the ability of restarting automata to recognize the (deterministic) context-free languages and some of their subclasses.

#*Generating compact representations of static scenes by means of 3D object hierarchies
#@Angel Domingo Sappa,Miguel Angel Garcia
#t2007
#cThe Visual Computer: International Journal of Computer Graphics
#index9100
#!This paper presents a new heuristic algorithm for computing a compact hierarchical representation of the objects contained in a 3D static scene. The algorithm first builds a fully-connected adjacency graph that keeps the costs of grouping the different pairs of objects of the scene. Afterward, the graph&#x2019;s minimum spanning tree is computed and its edges sorted in ascending order according to their cost. Next, from that sorted list, a cost-based clustering technique is applied, thus generating new objects at a higher level in the hierarchy. A new object can be defined after merging two or more objects according to their corresponding linking costs. The algorithm starts over by generating a new adjacency graph from those new objects, along with the objects that could not be merged before. The iterative process is applied until an adjacency graph with a single object is obtained. The latter is the root of the hierarchical representation. Balance and coherence of the hierarchy, in which spatially close objects are also structurally close, is achieved by defining an appropriate cost function. The proposed technique is evaluated upon several 3D scenes and compared to a previous technique. In addition, the benefits of the proposed technique with respect to techniques based on octrees and kd-trees are analyzed in terms of a practical application.

#!PERT and CPM, acronyms for "program evaluation and review technique" and "critical path method", respectively, are network techniques used to aid in the planning, scheduling, monitoring, and control of activities which are related to each other. For example, CPM is frequently used in the construction industry to help organize and schedule those activities which together constitute a given construction project. PERT was first used to help coordinate the activities in the development of the Polaris missle system. PERT and CPM differ from each other in that activity times are handled differently by these two closely related techniques. In using CPM, one assumes the activity times are known with certainty (deterministic activity times); PERT allows for uncertainty and statistical variation in activity times (stochastic activity times). Never the less, PERT and CPM are closely related (CPM may be a special case of PERT), and a variety of projects are subject to analysis by either technique:(1)(1) construction projects(2) planning and launching a new product(3) a turn around in an oil refinery (or other maintenance projects)(4) installing and debugging a computer system(5) scheduling ship construction and repairs(6) manufacture and assembly of large job-lot operations(7) missile countdown procedures(8) end-of-the month closing of accounting records(9) research and development projects

#!In this paper, we propose a feature-level fusion approach for improving the efficiency of palmprint identification. Multiple elliptical Gabor filters with different orientations are employed to extract the phase information on a palmprint image, which is then merged according to a fusion rule to produce a single feature called the Fusion Code. The similarity of two Fusion Codes is measured by their normalized hamming distance. A dynamic threshold is used for the final decisions. A database containing 9599 palmprint images from 488 different palms is used to validate the performance of the proposed method. Comparing our previous non-fusion approach and the proposed method, improvement in verification and identification are ensured.

It consists of two perpendicular exposures in SU-8 at &#x00b1;45&#x00b0;. DI water possesses a low absorption coefficient and a moderate and stable value of refractive index in near UV. Using water, the exposure angle in SU-8 can be increased to 50&#x00b0; from 35&#x00b0; in air necessary to pattern the desired 45&#x00b0; slope of the sidewalls. The principle of the proposed technique and the detailed fabrication process of the microoptic components will be presented. The integratability of the fabricated components was demonstrated by the fabrication of the microoptical fiber holder with a pre-aligned out-of-plane microlens.

#!Privacy concerns and practices, especially those dealing with the acquisition and use of consumer personal information, are at the forefront of global business and social issues associated with the information age. Our research examined the privacy policies of the Fortune 500 to assess the substance and content of their stated information practices and the degree to which they adhered to the fair information practices (FIP).From the observations, we developed a Privacy Policy Assessment Matrix that can be used to evaluate how well a firm addresses information privacy concerns. The matrix was used to analyze the Fortune 500 firms to understand their privacy maturity. The results provided practical and theoretical implications for addressing information privacy issues.

Optical networks must meet the challenge of supporting multiple types of transmissions including voice, video, and data traffic. Although time-division multiplexing (TDM) has provided a growth path for services, it is more constrained than IP + Optical strategies like the Cisco Dynamic Packet Transport (Resilient Packet Ring). The Cisco Systems® end-to-end IP + Optical networking strategy provides an intelligent converged network in which optical infrastructures can be used to their fullest potential.While most reference books focus on the theory involved in SONET and optical infrastructures, Cisco Self-Study: Building Cisco Metro Optical Networks (METRO) focuses on the practical application of planning and configuring optical networks that involve SONET, DWDM, Metropolitan Ethernet, Packet over SONET, and Dynamic Packet Transport (Resilient Packet Ring).Cisco Self-Study: Building Cisco Metro Optical Networks (METRO) is part of a recommended learning path from Cisco Systems that can include simulation and hands-on training from authorized Cisco Learning Partners and self-study products from Cisco Press.

#!Factor screening is performed to eliminate unimportant factors so that the remaining important factors can be more thoroughly studied in later experiments. Controlled Sequential Bifurcation (CSB) and Controlled Sequential Factorial Design (CSFD) are two new screening methods for discrete-event simulations. Both methods use hypothesis testing procedures to control the Type I Error and power of the screening results. The scenarios at which each method is most efficient are complementary. This paper proposes a two-stage hybrid approach to combine CSB and CSFD. The new method usually has the same error control as CSB and CSFD. The efficiency, on the other hand, is usually much better than either component method.

#cFinite Elements in Analysis and Design
#index9155
#!This paper demonstrates the application of both numerical simulation and empirical equation in predicting the penetration of a concrete target by an ogive-nosed projectile. The results from the experiment performed by Gran and Frew [In-target radial stress measurements from penetration experiments into concrete by ogive-nose steel projectiles, Int. J. Impact Eng. 19 (8) (1997) 715-726] are used as a benchmark for comparison. In the numerical simulations a 3.0-caliber radius-head steel ogival-nose projectile with a mass of 2.3 kg is fired against cylindrical concrete target with a striking velocity of 315m/s. The simulation, performed using AUTODYN 2-D, assesses three numerical schemes. namely Langrange, Euler-Lagrange coupling and smooth particles hydrodynamics SPH-Lagrange coupling, in predicting the maximum depth of penetration and the radial stress-time response of the concrete target. When assessing the three solution techniques we hypothesize that the effect of strain rate on strength for the concrete target does not adversely affect the prediction on the maximum depth of penetration and the radial stress-time response of the concrete target. In the empirical approach the penetration equation developed by Forrestal et al. [An empirical equation for penetration depth of ogive-nose projectiles into concrete targets, Int. J. Impact Eng. 15 (4) (1994) 395-405] is used to determine the maximum depth of penetration and the deceleration-time response. The deceleration-time response for the projectile using the empirical approach is compared with those obtained from the numerical simulations. Results from both the numerical and empirical approaches are consistent. The calculated depth of penetration from both approaches yield relatively good agreement with that obtained from the experiment The numerical simulations using each of the three numerical schemes are also able to reproduce the profiles from the radial stress measurements Simulations using the SPH numerical scheme give the best overall agreement. The good overall agreement with the experimental radial stress measurements and consistent results between both empirical and numerical approach, enhanced the confidence in engineers and ballisticians when using these two approaches in complementing full-scale testing.

Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed wavelet-based modeling technique.

#!In this paper, we introduce the cross-border logistics problem with fleet management. A major phenomenon of implementation of open-door policy in China is the move of Hong Kong-based manufacturers' production lines to China, crossing the border to take advantages of lower production costs, lower wages and lower rental costs. The finished products are then transshipped to Hong Kong, an efficient logistics hub well-equipped with reliable transportation facility, for exporting. We present a preemptive goal programming model for multi-objective cross-border logistics problem, in which three objectives are optimized hierarchically. We also describe a framework for incorporating decision-makers' opinions for determination of goal priorities and target values. A set of Hong Kong data have been used to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. Results demonstrate the decision-makers can find the flexibility and robustness of the proposed model by adjusting the goal priorities with respect to the importance of each objective.

#!Simulation has been widely used in the construction industry to optimize productivity and resource allocation. However, simulation research that provides an explicit method to investigate possible space conflicts is still limited. This paper suggests a cell-based modeling approach to represent space resources in construction simulation, which enables spatial conflict analysis and visualization of the worksite and of the occupation of spaces. Comparison between the cell-based modeling approach and MicroCYCLONE approach is done to investigate the validity of the new proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis is applied to both methods to find the optimal resource combination.

#!With advances in computer technology and digital human modeling methodology, it is possible to predict risks of potential injuries during manufacturing design prior to production, and make proactive ergonomic design for manufacturing assembly workstations involving human-machine interfaces. However, the productivity of manufacturing systems may be decreased, and this negative impact is difficult to evaluate in experimental and manufacturing environments. This research focuses on productivity issue for an automotive assembly workstation involving a lift assist device. To evaluate the productivity of the assembly workstation interfered by proactive ergonomic design, a prescriptive model of the automotive assembly system is developed and simulated with ProModel. This model and its simulation can not only evaluate the productivity, but also determine the maximum conveyor speed. Furthermore, this methodology using ProModel simulation to evaluate productivity and utilization described in this paper can be extended to evaluating other human-machine systems with dynamic, stochastic, and discrete-event characteristics.

#!Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for diverse monitoring applications. Event data are collected at various sensors and sent to selected storage nodes for further in-network processing. Since sensor nodes have strong constraints on their energy usage, this data transfer needs to be energy-efficient to maximize network lifetime. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for trading energy versus latency in sensor database systems. We propose a new protocol that carefully schedules message transmissions so as to avoid collisions at the MAC layer. Since all nodes adhere to the schedule, their radios can be off most of the time and only wake up during well-defined time intervals. We show how routing protocols can be optimized to interact symbiotically with scheduling decisions, resulting in significant energy savings at the cost of higher latency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by means of a thorough simulation study, using synthetic data as well as real-world traffic workloads.

#!Motivation: The resolution at which genomic alterations can be mapped by means of oligonucleotide aCGH (array-based comparative genomic hybridization) is limited by two factors: the availability of high-quality probes for the target genomic sequence and the array real-estate. Optimization of the probe selection process is required for arrays that are designed to probe specific genomic regions in very high resolution without compromising probe quality constraints. Results: In this paper we describe a well-defined optimization problem associated with the problem of probe selection for high-resolution aCGH arrays. We propose the whenever possible ∈-cover as a formulation that faithfully captures the requirement of probe selection problem, and provide a fast randomized algorithm that solves the optimization problem in O(n logn) time, as well as a deterministic algorithm with the same asymptotic performance. We apply the method in a typical high-definition array design scenario and demonstrate its superiority with respect to alternative approaches. Availability: Address requests to the authors.

#!This short report of the ECAI&dash;98 conference held in Brighton, England, in August 1998 addresses &ndash; from the cognitive scientist&rsquo;s point of view &ndash; some conceptual issues concerning the contents (subject matter) of the presented papers, as well as some conceptual ambiguities of overall arrangements of the conference. Due to the fact that cognitive scientists work especially on human behaviour &ndash; and are interested both in rational and fallible aspects of human nature &ndash; the conference revealed some fundamental inaccuracies of terminology frequently used in artificial intelligence research and engineering societies. This report questions these as well as the connection between intelligent behaviour and the formal systems presented at the conference.

#!Relevant component analysis (RCA) is a recently proposed metric learning method for semi-supervised learning applications. It is a simple and efficient method that has been applied successfully to give impressive results. However, RCA can make use of supervisory information in the form of positive equivalence constraints only. In this paper, we propose an extension to RCA that allows both positive and negative equivalence constraints to be incorporated. Experimental results show that the extended RCA algorithm is effective.

In this text, we give an explicit construction of all words w such that ni+1 ≤ 2ni + 1 for all i, and study these words. Special examples include characteristic Sturmian words, and more generally standard episturmian words. As an application, we study the values taken by the quantity lim supni+1/ni, and prove that it is minimal (among all nonperiodic words) for the Fibonacci word.

#!We present an approach to building a test collection of research papers. The approach is based on the Cranfield 2 tests but uses as its vehicle a current conference; research questions and relevance judgements of all cited papers are elicited from conference authors. The resultant test collection is different from TREC's in that it comprises scientific articles rather than newspaper text and, thus, allows for IR experiments that include citation information. The test collection currently consists of 170 queries with relevance judgements; the document collection is the ACL Anthology. We describe properties of our queries and relevance judgements, and demonstrate the use of the test collection in an experimental setup. One potentially problematic property of our collection is that queries have a low number of relevant documents; we discuss ways of alleviating this.

#!Teamwork has evolved to play an important role in science and is called for by funding agencies, universities, and industry. However, as important as teamwork nowadays is, teamwork may not be the only approach to produce relevant research results. Furthermore, cooperation does not always match its ideal and ranges from nominal collaboration to close interaction. Given that researchers in technical sciences are often rated as introverts, the question is whether this is true and how this affects their collaboration style and their capability to solve conflicts in collaboration. This paper presents the results of a study that investigates to what extent researchers collaborate, what their motivation for collaboration is, and how they deal with conflicts. Furthermore, the paper assesses the researchers' personality types and checks whether a correlation exists between collaboration-related choices and personality types. The study was carried out with researchers in the area of high-performance computing.

#!The architecture of the WALDMEISTER prover for unit equational deduction is based on a strict separation of active and passive facts. After an inspection of the system's proof procedure, the representation of each of the central data structures is outlined, namely indexing for the active facts, compression for the passive facts, successor sets for the hypotheses, and minimal recording of inference steps for the proof object. In order to cope with large search spaces, specialized redundancy criteria are employed, and the empirically gained control knowledge is integrated to ease the use of the system. The paper concludes with a quantitative comparison of the WALDMEISTER versions over the years, and a view of the future prospects.

#!This paper extends the gas-kinetic BGK-NS scheme to an adaptive grid for the viscous flow simulations. The grid movement and adaptation is controlled by a monitor function which may depend on velocity gradient or other flow variables, such as density or pressure. For the viscous flow computation, the use of adaptive mesh much improves the efficiency and accuracy of the method in comparison with the methods with static mesh points. The current method is an accurate and efficient method for the viscous flow computation, where the grid points can be easily moved and concentrated on the regions with large velocity and density gradients, such as the boundary layer and multi-material interface. Many numerical examples validate the current approach for the viscous flow simulations.

#*Essential Business Process Modeling
#@Michael Havey
#t2005
#c
#index9294
#!Ten years ago, groupware bundled with email and calendar applications helped track the flow of work from person to person within an organization. Workflow in today's enterprise means more monitoring and orchestrating massive systems. A new technology called Business Process Management, or BPM, helps software architects and developers design, code, run, administer, and monitor complex network-based business processesSound complicated? It is. But it's downright frustrating when you have to search the Web for every little piece of information vital to the process. Essential Business Process Modeling gathers all the concepts, design, architecture, and standard specifications of BPM into one concise book, and offers hands-on examples that illustrate BPM's approach to process notation, execution, administration and monitoring.Author Mike Havey demonstrates standard ways to code rigorous processes that are centerpieces of a service-oriented architecture (SOA), which defines how networks interact so that one can perform a service for the other. His book also shows how BPM complements enterprise application integration (EAI), a method for moving from older applications to new ones, and Enterprise Service BUS for integrating different web services, messaging, and XML technologies into a single network. BPM, he says, is to this collection of services what a conductor is to musicians in an orchestra: it coordinates their actions in the performance of a larger composition.Essential Business Process Modeling teaches you how to develop examples of process-oriented applications using free tools that can be run on an average PC or laptop. You'll also learn about BPM design patterns and best practices, as well as some underlying theory. The best way to monitor processes within an enterprise is with BPM, and the best way to navigate BPM is with this valuable book. BPM replaces those sketchy flowchart diagrams that business analysts draw on whiteboards with a precise model that uses standard graphical and XML representations, and an architecture that allows it converse with other services, systems, and users.

#!More robust developments of schemes for hyperbolic systems, that avoid dependence upon a characteristic decomposition have been achieved by employing schemes that are based on a Rusanov flux. Such schemes permit the construction of higher order approximations without recourse to characteristic decomposition. This is achieved by using the maximum eigenvalue of the hyperbolic system within the definition of the numerical flux. In recent literature the Rusanov flux has been embedded in a local Lax-Friedrichs flux. The current literature on these schemes only appears to indicate success in this regard, with no investigation of the effect of the additional numerical diffusion that is inherent in such formulations.In this paper the foundation for a new scheme is proposed which relies on the detection of the dominant wave in the system. This scheme is designed to permit the construction of lower and higher order approximations without recourse to characteristic decomposition while avoiding the excessive numerical diffusion that is inherent in the Rusanov and local Lax-Friedrichs fluxes.

#!We give a complexity theoretic classification of homomorphism problems for graphs and, more generally, relational structures obtained by restricting the left hand side structure in a homomorphism. For every class C of structures, let HOM(C,&minus;) be the problem of deciding whether a given structure A &isin;C has a homomorphism to a given (arbitrary) structure &szlig;. We prove that, under some complexity theoretic assumption from parameterized complexity theory, HOM(C,&minus;) is in polynomial time if and only if C has bounded tree width modulo homomorphic equivalence. Translated into the language of constraint satisfaction problems, our result yields a characterization of the tractable structural restrictions of constraint satisfaction problems. Translated into the language of database theory, it implies a characterization of the tractable instances of the evaluation problem for conjunctive queries over relational databases.

#!Conventional peer-to-peer (P2P) networks do not provide service differentiation and incentive for users. Therefore, users can easily obtain information without themselves contributing any information or service to a P2P community. This leads to the well known free-riding problem. Consequently, most of the information requests are directed towards a small number of P2P nodes which are willing to share information or provide service, causing the "tragedy of the commons." The aim of this paper is to provide service differentiation in a P2P network based on the amount of services each node has provided to the network community. Since the differentiation is based on nodes' prior contributions, the nodes are encouraged to share information/services with each other. We first introduce a resource distribution mechanism for all the information sharing nodes. The mechanism is distributed in nature, has linear time complexity, and guarantees Pareto-optimal resource allocation. Second, we model the whole resource request/distribution process as a competition game between the competing nodes. We show that this game has a Nash equilibrium. To realize the game, we propose a protocol in which the competing nodes can interact with the information providing node to reach Nash equilibrium efficiently and dynamically. We also present a generalized incentive mechanism for nodes having heterogeneous utility functions. Convergence analysis of the competition game is carried out. Examples are used to illustrate that the incentive protocol provides service differentiation and can induce productive resource sharing by rational network nodes.

#!The aim of this article is to provide a unified mathematical framework for program slicing which places all slicing work for sequential programs on a sound theoretical foundation. The main advantage to a mathematical approach is that it is not tied to a particular representation. In fact the mathematics provides a sound basis for any particular representation. We use the WSL (wide-spectrum language) program transformation theory as our framework. Within this framework we define a new semantic relation, semirefinement, which lies between semantic equivalence and semantic refinement. Combining this semantic relation, a syntactic relation (called reduction), and WSL's remove statement, we can give mathematical definitions for backwards slicing, conditioned slicing, static and dynamic slicing, and semantic slicing as program transformations in the WSL transformation theory. A novel technique of &ldquo;encoding&rdquo; operational semantics within a denotational semantics allows the framework to handle &ldquo;operational slicing&rdquo;. The theory also enables the concept of slicing to be applied to nondeterministic programs. These transformations are implemented in the industry-strength FermaT transformation system.

#!Many countries have created Web archiving projects aiming at long-term preservation of Web information, which is now considered precious in cultural and social aspects. However, because of its borderless character, the Web poses obstacles to comprehensively gathering information originating in a specific nation or culture.This paper proposes an efficient method for selectively collecting Web pages written in a specific language. First, a linguistic graph analysis of real Web data obtained from a large crawl is conducted in order to derive a crawling guideline, which makes use of language attributes per Web server. The guideline then is formed into a few variations of link selection strategies. Simulation-based evaluation reveals that one of the strategies, which carefully accepts newly discovered Web servers, shows superior results in terms of harvest rate&sol;coverage and runtime efficiency. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!Mixture of normals is a more general and flexible distribution for modeling of daily changes in market variables with fat tails and skewness. An efficient analytical Monte Carlo method was proposed by Wang and Taaffe for generating daily changes using a multivariate mixture of normal distributions with arbitrary covariance matrix. However the usual Cholesky Decomposition will fail if the covariance matrix is not positive definite. In practice, the covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated. The estimated covariance may be not positive definite. We propose a modified Cholesky decomposition for semi-definite matrices and also suggest an optimal semi-definite approximation for indefinite matrices.

#!Since their invention in the mid 1980s, Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems (ECC) have become an alternative to common Public-Key (PK) cryptosystems such as, e.g., RSA. The utilization of Elliptic Curves (EC) in cryptography is very promising because of their resistance against powerful index-calculus attacks. Providing a similar level of security as RSA, ECC allows for efficient implementation due to a significantly smaller bit size of the operands. It is widely accepted that the only feasible way to attack actual cryptosystems, if at all, is the application of dedicated hardware. In times of continuous technological improvements and increasing computing power, the question of the security of ECC against attacks based on special-purpose hardware and, in particular based on recently emerged low-cost FPGAs, arises.This work presents the first architecture with a corresponding FPGA implementation of an attack against ECC over prime fields. We describe an FPGA-based multi-processing hardware architecture for the Pollard-Rho method which is, to our knowledge, currently the most efficient attack against ECC. The implementation is running on a contemporary low-cost FPGA which allows for a much better cost-performance ratio than conventional CPUs. With the implementation at hand, a fairly accurate estimate about the cost of an FPGA-based attack can be given. We will extrapolate the results on actual ECC key lengths (128 bits and above) and estimate the expected runtimes for a successful attack. Since FPGA-based attacks are out of reach for key lengths exceeding 128 bits, we provide estimates for an ASIC design.Based on our results, currently used elliptic curve cryptosystems (160 bit and above) are infeasible to break with available computational and financial resources. However, some of the security standards proposed by the SECG in [2, 3] become subject to attacks based on low-cost FPGAs.

#!Computer problem diagnosis remains a serious challenge to users and support professionals. Traditional troubleshooting methods relying heavily on human intervention make the process inefficient and the results inaccurate even for solved problems, which contribute significantly to user's dissatisfaction. We propose to use system behavior information such as system event traces to build correlations with solved problems, instead of using only vague text descriptions as in existing practices. The goal is to enable automatic identification of the root cause of a problem if it is a known one, which would further lead to its resolution. By applying statistical learning techniques to classifying system call sequences, we show our approach can achieve considerable accuracy of root cause recognition by studying four case examples.

#!What began as an intrepid U.S. Government initiative in the early 1970's has turned into a global way of life. Indeed, with more than 500 million current users (and counting), the Internet has revolutionized the way societies function the world over. From dating and shopping online, to conducting informational research, to communicating via email, today seemingly everyone uses the Internet for one purpose or another. How, then, can something so vast and powerful be defiled by something as trivial as spam? It's true. The fact remains that despite the leading-edge technological sophistication fueling the Net, there are still many related annoyances that complicate and tarnish the Internet experience. And it doesn't matter if you're a homemaker in search of a fresh chicken recipe, or a civil engineer researching plans for a new skyscraper, the problems are the same. Internet Annoyances understands the universal nature of the Internet and strives to make its use as stress-free as possible. This insightful guide shows you how to overcome the most annoying Internet-related quirks, bugs, and hassles. You'll learn how to make a seamless connection, thwart would-be hackers, ensure greater security while surfing, eliminate pop-up ads, maximize online services, conduct more effective Google searches, better utilize digital media (music and video), and much more. In addition, Internet Annoyances discusses how to design and host a personal web site something once thought of as only possible for the technically gifted. Topics like blogs, domain names, setup, HTML, fonts, and graphics and are all dissected and analyzed for easy consumption. Unlike other books on the subject, Internet Annoyances assumes readers already possess a working knowledge of the Internet. By fully recognizing the experience level of today's Internet culture, author Preston Galla is able to cut immediately to the chase and not waste time on the more obvious points. Internet Annoyances, therefore, is a quick read that presents succinct solutions for the many glitches that still populate the Internet experience.

#!A conventional way to discriminate between objects represented by dissimilarities is the nearest neighbor method. A more efficient and sometimes a more accurate solution is offered by other dissimilarity-based classifiers. They construct a decision rule based on the entire training set, but they need just a small set of prototypes, the so-called representation set, as a reference for classifying new objects. Such alternative approaches may be especially advantageous for non-Euclidean or even non-metric dissimilarities. The choice of a proper representation set for dissimilarity-based classifiers is not yet fully investigated. It appears that a random selection may work well. In this paper, a number of experiments has been conducted on various metric and non-metric dissimilarity representations and prototype selection methods. Several procedures, like traditional feature selection methods (here effectively searching for prototypes), mode seeking and linear programming are compared to the random selection. In general, we find out that systematic approaches lead to better results than the random selection, especially for a small number of prototypes. Although there is no single winner as it depends on data characteristics, the k-centres works well, in general. For two-class problems, an important observation is that our dissimilarity-based discrimination functions relying on significantly reduced prototype sets (3-10% of the training objects) offer a similar or much better classification accuracy than the best k-NN rule on the entire training set. This may be reached for multi-class data as well, however such problems are more difficult.

This paper will show that this concept of learning curve improvements to production metrics can be applied based on cumulative time, rather than volume of production, for one-of-a-kind applications, such as space shuttle flights, where production quantities are very limited. Policy and process changes can also be observed in production data, and the learning curve is useful in the prediction of future trends. Past data from space shuttle processing is demonstrated to fit this new definition, and prediction of future process metrics is explored. Once the learning curve is time-based, simulation can be applied to model the system and enhance the prediction effort for future process metrics.

#!In this paper we discuss the issue of solving stochastic optimization problems using sampling methods. Numerical results have shown that using variance reduction techniques from statistics can result in significant improvements over Monte Carlo sampling in terms of the number of samples needed for convergence of the optimal objective value and optimal solution to a stochastic optimization problem. Among these techniques are stratified sampling and Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. However, for problems in high dimension, it may be computationally inefficient to calculate Quasi-Monte Carlo point sets in the full dimension. Rather, we wish to identify which dimensions are most important to the convergence and implement a Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling scheme with padding, where the important dimensions are sampled via Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling and the remaining dimensions with Monte Carlo sampling. We then incorporate this sampling scheme into an external sampling algorithm (ES-QMCP) to solve stochastic optimization problems.

#*A web-based tutoring system with styles-matching strategy for spatial geometric transformation

#cInteracting with Computers
#index9403
#!It has been a major objective for researchers to develop computer systems that can effectively deliver instruction to learners. Therefore, how to incorporate instructional strategies in computer-assisted learning systems in a systematic manner deserves further investigation. In this paper, a style-matching strategy that attempts to match learning materials' styles to learners' latent traits is proposed and realized in a web-based tutoring system, called CooTutor. The mechanism of adaptive material selection takes learners' different spatial ability and learning styles as an integral learning profile into account, and performs traits-based personalization of learning experience. This system is specifically designed to conquer the difficulty of tutoring the topic on fundamental spatial geometry in conventional curriculums. By conducting empirical evaluation with a small group of students, it is found that CooTutor is generally beneficial to learning the domain, but the effect of the styles-matching mechanism remains inconclusive. The work aims to contribute to the community of adaptive hypermedia in providing an explorative example adopting the concern of individual difference for personalization. The system design, a usage scenario, and an exploratory evaluation are presented in this paper as implications for further studies.

#*Inferring phylogeny from whole genomes
#@Paweł Górecki,Jerzy Tiuryn

#cBioinformatics
#index9404
#!Motivation: Inferring species phylogenies with a history of gene losses and duplications is a challenging and an important task in computational biology. This problem can be solved by duplication-loss models in which the primary step is to reconcile a rooted gene tree with a rooted species tree. Most modern methods of phylogenetic reconstruction (from sequences) produce unrooted gene trees. This limitation leads to the problem of transforming unrooted gene tree into a rooted tree, and then reconciling rooted trees. The main questions are 'What about biological interpretation of choosing rooting?', 'Can we find efficiently the optimal rootings?', 'Is the optimal rooting unique?'. Results: In this paper we present a model of reconciling unrooted gene tree with a rooted species tree, which is based on a concept of choosing rooting which has minimal reconciliation cost. Our analysis leads to the surprising property that all the minimal rootings have identical distributions of gene duplications and gene losses in the species tree. It implies, in our opinion, that the concept of an optimal rooting is very robust, and thus biologically meaningful. Also, it has nice computational properties. We present a linear time and space algorithm for computing optimal rooting(s). This algorithm was used in two different ways to reconstruct the optimal species phylogeny of five known yeast genomes from approximately 4700 gene trees. Moreover, we determined locations (history) of all gene duplications and gene losses in the final species tree. It is interesting to notice that the top five species trees are the same for both methods.

#!A recent paper in SIGMICRO [1] contained a comparison of the accuracy of floating point vs. rational representations, which is very unfair to the latter. The format chosen for rational numbers utilizes 16 bits for numerators and 16 bits for denominators. This implies that the spacing between consecutive numbers in the system is in most cases of the order 2-32. Only around simple rational numbers (e.g. 1/1, 2/3) is the spacing of the order 2-16. However the rounding algorithm presented in [1] will almost certainly introduce a rounding error of the order 2-16, i.e. introduce an error which in most cases is of the order 216 larger than necessary.

#!Design automation over the years has taken many forms. Engineering projects of every description have been targeted by computer specialists as systems which might benefit from automation. Today, several major firms are marketing CAD/CAM systems in a big way. Electrical design workstations and mechanical part workstations and data bases have been most successful and these companies are continually refining and improving their systems looking towards the future. Though there are many consulting firms available to assist in the automation of an interested engineering organization, many project managers still resist the automation tide. This paper is an exploration of several areas which will need to be addressed in the years to come if automation is to be successfully applied to even the most complex of engineering undertakings. The exploration is facilitated through the elucidation of important structures which appear in engineering organizations. The hope is that through the understanding of these implicit structures, computational systems can be built which reflect these structures and thereby provide additional project coherence. The primary areas affected are management, verification, inter-module communication and integration. This work is continuing under the leadership of Dr. F.B. Thompson at the California Institute of Technology.

Methods Eng. 17 (1981) 679-706] of hourglass control in prisms with pentagons or hexagons as bases is addressed. This hourglass control is based on the description of strain-displacement modes through an orthogonal basis set as it is described in the paper of Margolin and Pyun for 2D quadrilateral cells [L.G. Margolin, J.J. Pyun, A method for treating hourglass patterns, in: C.T. Taylor, N.M. Hafey (Eds.), Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Numerical Methods in Laminar and Turbulent Flow, Montreal, Canada, 1987]. In this generalized approach, using shape functions is not necessary anymore. It follows that elements for which regular isoparametric shape functions do not exist can be treated. The method may also be used to handle usual element classes such as pyramids, prisms with triangles as bases and hexahedra. Results for the spherical problem are given.

#!Embedded systems are rapidly growing in size, complexity, distribution, and heterogeneity. As a result, the traditional practice of developing one-off embedded applications that are often rigid and unmanageable is no longer acceptable. Recent studies have suggested that an effective approach to developing software systems in this domain is to employ the principles of software architecture. However, for software architectural concepts to be truly useful in a development setting, they must be accompanied by support for their implementation and evolution. This has motivated our work over the past several years on an architectural middleware, called Prism-MW, that provides implementation-level support for the development of software systems in terms of the software architectural constructs (e.g., components, connectors). Prism-MW was initially developed in Java and used in several domains. Recently, as part of an on-going project, we were required to implement Prism-MW in ANSI C++. This experience proved to be more challenging than we initially anticipated, mainly due to the inherent heterogeneity of the computing substrate. As a result of this experience, we had to reconsider some of our earlier assumptions of what constitutes an architectural middleware and its role in the software development process. In this paper, we provide an overview of our experience and the lessons we have learned along the way.

The results of such studies turn out to be quite variable, sometimes showing improved student performance, and sometimes not. One reason for this rather disturbing variance may arise from the common practice of comparing the performance of two groups of students differing only in that one group is exposed to the new technique and the other is not. Many instructional media, particularly those that emphasize individual study, cannot be exploited to their maximum effectiveness when they are used in conjunction with an otherwise "conventional" lecture-oriented course format.

#!The information model chosen by the ISO for the management of open systems is object&dash;oriented. We provide an effective mapping from the structural and behavioural specification of the managed objects of open systems to a compact logical form suitable for model&dash;based diagnosis. Based thereon, we present an efficient algorithm that localizes faults by repairing logical models invalidated through system observations and show that it computes all minimal diagnoses.

#!This paper proposes a multi-modal telecommunication system using a facial expression robot. We developed a telecommunication system which projects the facial expression of an operator to a remote place using the facial expression robot "Infanoid2." The facial information of the operator is measured using a stereo camera system and projected through a robot in order to communicate with another person in a remote location. Impression evaluation experiment is performed using this system. This paper discusses the effectiveness of robots as a telecommunication medium based on the experimental results.

#!A novel and practical approach is presented in this paper that solves a constrained free-form deformation (FFD) problem where the developability of the tessellated embedded surface patches is preserved during the lattice deformation. The formulated constrained FFD problem has direct application in areas of product design where the surface developability is required, such as clothing, ship hulls, automobile parts, etc. In the proposed approach, the developability-preserved FFD problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Different from other contained FFD approaches, the positions of lattice control points are not modified in our algorithm -- as their control is insufficient in regards to the developability of all the nodes in the mesh. Moreover, the optimization is performed on the parameters of the mesh nodes rather than directly modifying their 3D coordinates, which avoids the time-consuming inverse calculation of the parameters of every node in a non-parallelepiped control lattice when further deformations are required.

#*Phylogeny reconstruction: increasing the accuracy of pairwise distance estimation using Bayesian inference of evolutionary rates

#cBioinformatics
#index9487
#!Distance-based methods for phylogeny reconstruction are the fastest and easiest to use, and their popularity is accordingly high. They are also the only known methods that can cope with huge datasets of thousands of sequences. These methods rely on evolutionary distance estimation and are sensitive to errors in such estimations. In this study, a novel Bayesian method for estimation of evolutionary distances is developed. The proposed method enables the use of a sophisticated evolutionary model that better accounts for among-site rate variation (ASRV), thereby improving the accuracy of distance estimation. Rate variations are estimated within a Bayesian framework by extracting information from the entire dataset of sequences, unlike standard methods that can only use one pair of sequences at a time. We compare the accuracy of a cascade of distance estimation methods, starting from commonly used methods and moving towards the more sophisticated novel method. Simulation studies show significant improvements in the accuracy of distance estimation by the novel method over the commonly used ones. We demonstrate the effect of the improved accuracy on tree reconstruction using both real and simulated protein sequence alignments. An implementation of this method is available as part of the SEMPHY package. Contact: talp@tau.ac.il

#!A novel non-parametric density estimator is developed based on geometric principles. A penalised centroidal Voronoi tessellation forms the basis of the estimator, which allows the data to self-organise in order to minimise estimate bias and variance. This approach is a marked departure from usual methods based on local averaging, and has the advantage of being naturally adaptive to local sample density (scale-invariance). The estimator does not require the introduction of a plug-in kernel, thus avoiding assumptions of symmetricity and morphology. A numerical experiment is conducted to illustrate the behaviour of the estimator, and it's characteristics are discussed.

#!We address the problem of image similarity in the compressed domain, using a multivariate statistical test for comparing color distributions. Our approach is based on the multivariate Wald-Wolfowitz test, a nonparametric test that assesses the commonality between two different sets of multivariate observations. Using some pre-selected feature attributes, the similarity measure provides a comprehensive estimate of the match between different images based on graph theory and the notion of minimal spanning tree (MST). Feature extraction is directly provided from the JPEG discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain, without involving full decompression or inverse DCT. Based on the zig-zag scheme, a novel selection technique is introduced that guarantees image's enhanced invariance to geometric transformations. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, the application on a diverse collection of images has been systematically studied in a query-by-example image retrieval task. Experimental results show that a powerful measure of similarity between compressed images can emerge from the statistical comparison of their pattern representations.

#!Usage-awaRe Interactive Content Adaptation (URICA) is an automatic technique that adapts content for display on mobile devices based on usage semantics. URICA allows users who are unsatisfied with the system's adaptation decision to take control of the adaptation process and make changes until the content is suitably adapted for their purposes. The successful adaptation is recorded and used in making future adaptation decisions. To validate URICA, we implemented a prototype system called Chameleon that performs fidelity adaptation on web images. We conducted a user study in which participants used Chameleon to browse image-rich web pages on bandwidth-limited cellular links and used the collected traces to evaluate our system. We show that Chameleon reduces the latency for browsing web content by up to 65% and reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 80%. Chameleon also allows users to exchange bandwidth consumption for user interaction based on their personal preferences.

With over 8 billion pages online and more posted every day, the Web more than likely contains the information you're looking for - if only you could find it. In Information Trapping: Real-Time Research on the Web, Internet-search-engine expert Tara Calishain makes researching more efficient and rewarding for anyone for whom the Web is an indispensable tool - academics, journalists, scientists, and professionals, as well as bloggers, genealogists, and hobbyists. She does so by teaching the latest techniques for building automated information-gathering systems. As an alternative to the typical one-time search for information, Tara demonstrates how readers can use RSS feeds, page monitoring tools, and other software to set up information streams of many different data types - from text to multimedia to conversations - for capture and review.

#!In recent years, the modeling and analysis techniques developed in the area of formal languages and of concurrent process calculi have been successfully applied to the field of Systems Biology. In this setting, Brane Calculi and Membrane Systems are two of the most prominent approaches for the modeling of the behaviour of biological membranes. Membrane Systems have been introduced by Gh. P&acaron;un as a class of distributed parallel computing devices of a biochemical type, while Brane Calculi are a family of process calculi, based on a set of biologically inspired primitives of membrane interaction. In this paper we model the behaviour of a biological process - namely, the LDL Cholesterol Degradation Pathway - in both Brane Calculi and Membrane Systems. We also provide a brief discussion on the application of analysis techniques to this case study.

#!Traditionally, fingerprint matching is minutia-based, which establishes the minutiae correspondences between two fingerprints. In this paper, a novel fingerprint matching algorithm is presented, which establishes both the ridge correspondences and the minutia correspondences between two fingerprints. First N initial substructure (including a minutia and adjacent ridges) pairs are found by a novel alignment method. Based on each of these substructure pairs, ridge matching is performed by incrementally matching ridges and minutiae, and then a matching score is computed. The maximum one of the N scores is used as the final matching score of two fingerprints. Preliminary results on FVC2002 databases show that ridge matching approach performs comparably with the minutia-based one.

#!Outlier detection is concerned with discovering exceptional behaviors of objects. Its theoretical principle and practical implementation lay a foundation for some important applications such as credit card fraud detection, discovering criminal behaviors in e-commerce, discovering computer intrusion, etc. In this paper, we first present a unified model for several existing outlier detection schemes, and propose a compatibility theory, which establishes a framework for describing the capabilities for various outlier formulation schemes in terms of matching users'intuitions. Under this framework, we show that the density-based scheme is more powerful than the distance-based scheme when a dataset contains patterns with diverse characteristics. The density-based scheme, however, is less effective when the patterns are of comparable densities with the outliers. We then introduce a connectivity-based scheme that improves the effectiveness of the density-based scheme when a pattern itself is of similar density as an outlier. We compare density-based and connectivity-based schemes in terms of their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate applications with different features where each of them is more effective than the other. Finally, connectivity-based and density-based schemes are comparatively evaluated on both real-life and synthetic datasets in terms of recall, precision, rank power and implementation-free metrics.

#!What are models and how is the relatively new technology of Model-Based Reasoning different from conventional modelling in science and engineering? These questions are explored in this paper by examining the fundamental nature of models. We explore model characteristics, different classes of model and various dimensions of the modelling space. Our analysis puts models into a general framework from which emerges the interesting case of qualitative models. Inevitably, such a broad treatment must be a personal view but the objective is to draw attention to key issues. Our aim is to increase understanding of the modelling process and clarify the options available for model builders. We argue that the technology known as Model-Based Reasoning, which uses explicit, executable models is a powerful and widely applicable approach that has much potential for managing the complexity encountered in many application domains. The advantages of the method include an emphasis on principled model design, the ability to guarantee completeness of the solutions and powerful reuse and automation opportunities.

QoS refers to the capability of a network to provide better service to selected network traffic over various LAN and WAN technologies. The primary goal of QoS is to provide flow priority, including dedicated bandwidth, controlled jitter and latency (required by some interactive and delay-sensitive traffic), and improved loss characteristics.While QoS has become an essential technology for those organizations rolling out a new generation of network applications such as real-time voice communications and high-quality video delivery, most of the literature available on this foundation technology for current and future business applications focuses on IP QoS. Equally important is the application of QoS in the campus LAN environment, which is primarily responsible for delivering traffic to the desktop.Cisco Catalyst QoS is the first book to concentrate exclusively on the application of QoS in the campus environment. This practical guide provides you with insight into the operation of QoS on the most popular and widely deployed LAN devices: the Cisco Catalyst family of switches. Leveraging the authors' extensive expertise at Cisco in the support of Cisco Catalyst switches and QoS deployment, the book presents QoS from the campus LAN perspective. It explains why QoS is essential in this environment in order to achieve a more deterministic behavior for traffic when implementing voice, video, or other delay-sensitive applications. Through architectural overviews, configuration examples, real-world deployment case studies, and summaries of common pitfalls, you will understand how QoS operates, the different components involved in making QoS possible, and how QoS can be implemented on the various Cisco Catalyst platforms to enable truly successful end-to-end QoS applications.This book is part of the Networking Technology Series from Cisco Press, which offers networking professionals valuable information for constructing efficient networks, understanding new technologies, and building successful careers.

#*Adobe Photoshop Master Class: Maggie Taylor's Landscape of Dreams (Adobe Master Class)

#!Maggie Taylor's digital photo collages have been described as a contemporary exploration of the Surrealist world view. In Taylor's strange, parallel universe, birds ride bicycles, ideas materialize in the shape of clouds, and wings sprout from the backs of prim Victorian women. Starting with objects that she finds on eBay, in flea markets, and in her own surroundings, Taylor then uses her ï¾ flatbed scanner, Adobe Photoshop, and an Iris printer, to produce images of surprising beauty and emotional impact. ï¾ Adobe Photoshop Master Class: Maggie Taylor's Landscape of Dreams offers a close and richly illustrated examination of Taylor's practice, tracing her images from inspiration through execution. Taylor explains her influences, both in art and in her own life, and takes the reader inside the making of some of her intriguing, painterly work. Along the way, we hear from respected artists and critics familiar with Taylor's work, and from the artist herself, in conversation with the author. ï¾ Illustrated with more than 65 color plates, Landscape of Dreams is essential reading (and viewing) for all those interested in applying technology to a creative personal vision.

#%458875
#!A computational method is proposed for problems where fluid-structure interaction is combined with solid-rigid contact. This combination is particularly important for the dynamics and impact of heart valves. The Navier-Stokes equation in an Eulerian setting is coupled to a Neo-Hookean solid model using a Lagrangian description. A fictitious domain method extended with a local mesh adaptation algorithm provides the required flexibility with respect to the motion and deformation of the valve. In addition, it ensures the solids ability of sustaining pressures present in the fluid. Making use of the fact that the fluid and solid mesh are not required to be connected conformingly, it is shown that the model can be extended with a contact algorithm without introducing meshing complications near the contact surfaces.

#!Transportation planners and public transport operators alike have become increasingly aware of the need to diffuse the concentration of the peak period travel. Differentiated pricing is one possible method to even out the demand and reduce peak load requirement. An evaluation of the potential effectiveness of strategies directed to flatten the demand distribution requires an understanding of the underlying factors that drive travel behavior (e.g., time-shifting, route change, mode change) with regard to price and service. In this paper, we present a Passenger Railway Network Simulation model with the intention of linking supply and demand. The objective is to evaluate the differentiated pricing impact on the passenger travel behavior, and consequently on the overall network performance, both financially and operationally. This paper focuses on the design and modeling approach of the Travel Behavior Model.

#!In multiparty MAC, a sender needs to transmit each packet to a set of receivers within its transmission range. Bandwidth efficiency of wireless multiparty MAC can be improved substantially by exploiting the fact that several receivers can be reached at the MAC layer by a single transmission. Multiparty communication, however, requires new design paradigms since systematic design techniques that have been used effectively in unicast and wireline multicast do not apply. For example, a transmission policy that maximizes the stability region of the network need not maximize the network throughput. Therefore, the objective is to design a policy that maximizes the system throughput subject to maintaining stability. We present a sufficient condition that can be used to establish the throughput optimality of a stable transmission policy. We subsequently design a distributed adaptive stable policy that allows a sender to decide when to transmit using simple computations. The computations are based only on limited information about current transmissions in the sender's neighborhood. Even though the proposed policy does not use any network statistics, it attains the same throughput as an optimal offline stable policy that uses in its decision process past, present, and even future network states. We prove the throughpOut optimality of this policy using the sufficient condition and the large deviation results. We present a MAC protocol for acquiring the local information necessary for executing this policy, and implement it in ns-2. The performance evaluations demonstrate that the optimal policy significantly outperforms the existing multiparty schemes in ad hoc networks.

#!Surface interrogation and intersection depend crucially on good root-finding algorithms, which in turn depend on accurate polynomial evaluation. Conventional algorithms for evaluation typically encounter difficulties near multiple roots, or roots that are very close, and this may lead to gross errors in the geometric computation, or even catastrophic failure. In this paper we study the cost and accuracy of several approaches to polynomial evaluation, explaining the reasons for non-convergence of certain methods, and supporting our subsequent conclusions with the results of benchmarking experiments.

#index9616
#!An intelligent agent may receive information about its environment from several different sources. How should the agent merge these items of information into a single, consistent piece? Taking our lead from the contraction+expansion approach to belief revision, we envisage a two-stage approach to this problem. The first stage consists of weakening the individual pieces of information into a form in which they can be consistently added together. The second, trivial, stage then consists of simply adding together the information thus obtained. This paper is devoted mainly to the first stage of this process, which we call social contraction. We consider both a postulational and a procedural approach to social contraction. The latter builds on the author's framework of belief negotiation models. With the help of Spohn-type rankings we provide two possible instantiations of this extended framework. This leads to two interesting concrete families of social contraction functions.

#!In this paper we present Parallel Computing with Mobile Agents (PaCMAn), a mobile agent based Metacomputer that enables its users to utilize idle resources on the internet to tackle computational problems that could not be handled efficiently with their own resources. The PaCMAn launches multiple mobile agents that cooperate and communicate to solve problems in parallel. Each agent supports the basic communication and synchronization tasks of the classical parallel worker assuming the role of a process in a parallel processing application. Application tasks, however, are assigned dynamically to the PaCMAn's mobile agents via TaskHandlers. TaskHandlers are Java objects capable of implementing particular tasks of the application. The PaCMAn consists of three major components: Broker, Server and Client. A server machine has to be explicitly registered in order to take part in the PaCMAn Metacomputer. A number of brokers keep track of the available resources. In the PaCMAn system both server and client machines can be located anywhere in the Internet. The clients select the servers that they will utilize based on the specific resource requirements. We have developed and tested prototype systems with several applications. These prototypes provide proof of concept of our proposed Metacomputing philosophy. Furthermore they have demonstrated that PaCMAn provides parallel efficiency. We also demonstrate that the PaCMAn Metacomputer can be used as the computational engine for the creation of sophisticated Pervasive Services anywhere anytime.

Class relationships are used at runtime to select the computationally simplest feature space that allows classification at high level of confidence for each example view. Classification accuracies can then be further improved using rank-order voting over multiple views. Our experimental results show that our system compares favorably to previously published results using a demanding benchmark. The results support the hypothesis that class hierarchies based on visual similarities are feasible and useful in controlling the accuracy vs. speed tradeoffs in classification.

#@Ai Li,Steve Horvath
#t2007
#cBioinformatics
#index9646
#!Motivation: The goal of neighborhood analysis is to find a set of genes (the neighborhood) that is similar to an initial 'seed' set of genes. Neighborhood analysis methods for network data are important in systems biology. If individual network connections are susceptible to noise, it can be advantageous to define neighborhoods on the basis of a robust interconnectedness measure, e.g. the topological overlap measure. Since the use of multiple nodes in the seed set may lead to more informative neighborhoods, it can be advantageous to define multi-node similarity measures. Results: The pairwise topological overlap measure is generalized to multiple network nodes and subsequently used in a recursive neighborhood construction method. A local permutation scheme is used to determine the neighborhood size. Using four network applications and a simulated example, we provide empirical evidence that the resulting neighborhoods are biologically meaningful, e.g. we use neighborhood analysis to identify brain cancer related genes. Availability: An executable Windows program and tutorial for multi-node topological overlap measure (MTOM) based analysis can be downloaded from the webpage (http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/MTOM/).

#!In this article, the problem of classifying a new observation vector into one of the two known groups Πi, i = 1, 2, distributed as multivariate normal with common covariance matrix is considered. The total number of observation vectors from the two groups is, however, less than the dimension of the observation vectors. A sample-squared distance between the two groups, using Moore-Penrose inverse, is introduced. A classification rule based on the minimum distance is proposed to classify an observation vector into two or several groups. An expression for the error of misclassification when there are only two groups is derived for large p and n = O(pδ), 0 < δ < 1.

#!Using ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) for high-speed IP address lookup has been gaining popularity due to its deterministic high performance. However, restricted by the slow improvement of memory accessing speed, the route lookup engines for next-generation terabit routers demand exploiting parallelism among multiple TCAM chips. Traditional parallel methods always incur excessive redundancy and high power consumption. We propose in this paper an original TCAM-based IP lookup scheme that achieves both ultra-high lookup throughput and optimal utilization of the memory while being power-efficient. In our multi-chip scheme, we devise a load-balanced TCAM table construction algorithm together with an adaptive load balancing mechanism. The power efficiency is well controlled by decreasing the number of TCAM entries triggered in each lookup operation. Using four 133 MHz TCAM chips and given 25% more TCAM entries than the original route table, the proposed scheme achieves a lookup throughput of up to 533 MPPS while remains simple for ASIC implementation.

Although CAI has proven to be a more efficient learning tool than common traditional methods in specific instances, the overall success of such systems has been sporadic. There is no question that a well-designed and correctly implemented CAI system can be highly effective; however, several important factors must be overcome to guarantee a reasonable amount of success. These are:&bull; Overcoming the present high cost of hardware while still providing a reliable system having acceptable display capability.&bull; Developing a software real-time operating system which guarantees fast response times.&bull; Authoring high quality courseware.

#!Decision-making situations in real life differ regarding their explicitness of positive and negative consequences as well as regarding the directness of probabilities for reward and punishment. In neuropsychological research, decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk are differentiated. To assess decisions under ambiguity the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is one of the most frequently used tasks. Decisions under risk can be measured by a task that offers explicit rules for gains and losses and stable winning probabilities, as the Game of Dice Task (GDT) does. In this contribution we firstly summarize studies that investigated decision-making in various groups of patients using the IGT or the GDT. We also propose a new model of decision-making in risky situations and describe differences between decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk from a theoretical and clinical perspective.

Based on observed activity, intent, and capability, the deployed forces can be redirected toward high-valued targets. A discussion of the force development and integration will be provided to satisfy tactical and strategic issues, as well as its applicability to broader theater and campaign level issues. The results of this effort will help define requirements for enhancing command and control, based upon allocation of reconnaissance resources.

#!We present the results of coverage tests performed to validate our preliminary analysis indicating that determining 'appropriate' run length is more important for obtaining coverage than performing 'proper' transient analysis. Our preliminary experiment was designed with the intention of showing students the pitfalls of performing 'bad' transient analysis when estimating steady-state parameters. However, we found that for short run lengths any transient truncation diminishes coverage; and it is only beneficial to delete transient data when long runs of the output data are available. As with the preliminary analysis, two types of systems are analyzed (M/M/1/GD/&infin;/&infin; systems and an M/M/s/GD/&infin;/&infin;); additionally, coverage tests are also conducted on 3-stage M/M/1/GD/&infin;/&infin; queuing systems. The coverage analysis supports our preliminary conclusion: when first exposing students to the subject of output analysis on non-terminating systems, strong emphasis should be placed on choosing proper run length and the time devoted to transient analysis can be reduced.

#!Graph pyramids are often used for representing irregular image pyramids. For the 2D case, combinatorial pyramids have been recently defined in order to explicitly represent more topological information than graph pyramids. The main contribution of this work is the definition of pyramids of n-dimensional (nD) generalized maps. This extends the previous works to any dimension, and generalizes them in order to represent any type of pyramid constructed by using any removal and/or contraction operations. We give basic algorithms that allow to build an nD generalized pyramid that describes a multi-level segmented image. A pyramid of nD generalized maps can be implemented in several ways. We propose three possible representations and give conversion algorithms.

#!A graph separator is a set of vertices or edges whose removal divides an input graph into components of bounded size. This paper describes new algorithms for computing separators in planar graphs as well as techniques that can be used to speed up the implementation of graph partitioning algorithms and improve the partition quality. In particular, we consider planar graphs with costs and weights on the vertices, where weights are used to estimate the sizes of the partitions and costs are used to estimate the size of the separator. We show that in these graphs one can always find a small cost separator (consisting of vertices or edges) that partitions the graph into components of bounded weight. We describe implementations of the partitioning algorithms and discuss results of our experiments.

#!The feedback stabilization problem for ensembles of coupled spin 1/2 systems is discussed from a control theoretic perspective. The noninvasive nature of the bulk measurement allows in principle for a fully unitary and deterministic closed loop. The Lyapunov-based feedback design presented does not require spins that are selectively addressable. With this method, it is possible to obtain control inputs also for difficult tasks, like suppressing undesired couplings in identical spin systems.

#!We study an acceleration method for point-to-point shortest-path computations in large and sparse directed graphs with given nonnegative arc weights. The acceleration method is called the arc-flag approach and is based on Dijkstra's algorithm. In the arc-flag approach, we allow a preprocessing of the network data to generate additional information, which is then used to speedup shortest-path queries. In the preprocessing phase, the graph is divided into regions and information is gathered on whether an arc is on a shortest path into a given region. The arc-flag method combined with an appropriate partitioning and a bidirected search achieves an average speedup factor of more than 500 compared to the standard algorithm of Dijkstra on large networks (1 million nodes, 2.5 million arcs). This combination narrows down the search space of Dijkstra's algorithm to almost the size of the corresponding shortest path for long-distance shortest-path queries. We conduct an experimental study that evaluates which partitionings are best suited for the arc-flag method. In particular, we examine partitioning algorithms from computational geometry and a multiway arc separator partitioning. The evaluation was done on German road networks. The impact of different partitions on the speedup of the shortest path algorithm are compared. Furthermore, we present an extension of the speedup technique to multiple levels of partitions. With this multilevel variant, the same speedup factors can be achieved with smaller space requirements. It can, therefore, be seen as a compression of the precomputed data that preserves the correctness of the computed shortest paths.

#!Entropy minimization is closely associated with pattern recognition. The present contribution uses a direct minimization of an entropy like function to solve the blind source separation problem for image reconstruction. The mixture patterns are decomposed using SVD and then global stochastic optimization is used to find the first irreducible image pattern. Further images are then subsequently reconstructed, by imposing a 2D correlation coefficient for dissimilarity to prevent repeated images, until all images are exhaustively enumerated. Three test cases are used, including (1) a set of three black and white texturally different photographs (2) a set of three RGB geometrically similar photographs and (3) an underdetermined problem involving an imbedded watermark. Cases 1 and 2 are easily solved with outstanding image quality. Both searches are conducted in an unsupervised manner-no a priori information is used. In Case 3, the watermark is enhanced after targeting the region for entropy minimization. The present results have a wide variety of applications, including image and spectroscopic analysis.

#!Microfluidics-based biochips consist of microfluidic arrays on rigid substrates through which, movement of fluids is tightly controlled to facilitate biological reactions. Biochips are soon expected to revolutionize biosensing, clinical diagnostics, and drug discovery. Critical to the deployment of biochips in such diverse areas is the dependability of these systems. Thus, robust testing techniques are required to ensure an adequate level of system dependability. Due to the underlying mixed technology and energy domains, such biochips exhibit unique failure mechanisms and defects. In this article we present a highly effective fault diagnosis strategy that uses a single source and sink to detect and locate multiple faults in a microfluidic array, without flooding the array, a problem that has hampered realistic implementations of all existing strategies. The strategy renders itself well for a built-in self-test that could drastically reduce the operating cost of microfluidic biochips. It can be used during both the manufacturing phase of the biochip, as well as field operation. Furthermore, the algorithm can pinpoint the actual fault, as opposed to merely the faulty regions that are typically identified by strategies proposed in the literature. Also, analytical results suggest that it is an effective strategy that can be used to design highly dependable biochip systems.

The main receivers on trial are the Zero-Forcing and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) algorithm-based receivers and their variants, employing Parallel interference cancellation (PIC) and Iterative Partial Cancellation (IPC) schemes. To assess its performance in an existing system, the uncoded Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard was considered (using solely QPSK modulation) alongside the reference UMTS environments. The BER performance is assessed both by simulation and by semi-analytical processing.

#!Discrete-event simulation and control-theoretic approaches lend themselves to studying semiconductor manufacturing supply-chain systems. In this work, we detail a modeling approach for semiconductor manufacturing supply-chain systems in a hybrid DEVS/MPC testbed that supports experimentations for DEVS and MPC models using KIBDEVS/MPC. This testbed supports detailed analysis and design of interactions between discrete processes and tactical controller. A set of experiments have been devised to illustrate the role of modeling interactions between Discrete Event System Specification and Model Predictive Control models. The testbed offers novel features to methodically identify and analyze complex model interactions and thus support alternative designs based on tradeoffs between model resolutions and execution times.

#!A prefix-free language is prime if it cannot be decomposed into a concatenation of two prefix-free languages. We show that we can check in polynomial time if a language generated by a simple context-free grammar is prime. Our algorithm computes a canonical representation of a simple language, converting its arbitrary simple grammar into prime normal form (PNF); a simple grammar is in PNF if all its nonterminals define primes. We also improve the complexity of testing the equivalence of simple grammars. The best previously known algorithm for this problem worked in O(n13) time. We improve it to O(n7 log2 n) and O(n5 polylog v) time, where n is the total size of the grammars involved, and v is the length of a shortest string derivable from a nonterminal, maximized over all nonterminals.

#!Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of interacting autonomous agents. ABMS promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use electronic laboratories to do research. Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS is a new way of doing science. Computational advances make possible a growing number of agent-based applications across many fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare, from modeling the growth and decline of ancient civilizations to modeling the complexities of the human immune system, and many more. This tutorial describes the foundations of ABMS, identifies ABMS toolkits and development methods illustrated through a supply chain example, and provides thoughts on the appropriate contexts for ABMS versus conventional modeling techniques.

#!This paper presents a novel approach to the fast computation of Zernike moments from a digital image. Most existing fast methods for computing Zernike moments have focused on the reduction of the computational complexity of the Zernike 1-D radial polynomials by introducing their recurrence relations. Instead, in our proposed method, we focus on the reduction of the complexity of the computation of the 2-D Zernike basis functions. As Zernike basis functions have specific symmetry or anti-symmetry about the x-axis, the y-axis, the origin, and the straight line y=x, we can generate the Zernike basis functions by only computing one of their octants. As a result, the proposed method makes the computation time eight times faster than existing methods. The proposed method is applicable to the computation of an individual Zernike moment as well as a set of Zernike moments. In addition, when computing a series of Zernike moments, the proposed method can be used with one of the existing fast methods for computing Zernike radial polynomials. This paper also presents an accurate form of Zernike moments for a discrete image function. In the experiments, results show the accuracy of the form for computing discrete Zernike moments and confirm that the proposed method for the fast computation of Zernike moments is much more efficient than existing fast methods in most cases.

It establishes a different relationship between designing and documenting, one where the primary emphasis is shifted to documentation. The activities of documenting become the "process" by which a quality design can be achieved. A strategic documentation framework combined with a high-level design language to form and test the proper solution is suggested as a means of achieving quality designs.

#!Brilliantly compiled by author Juval Lowy, Programming .NET Components, Second Edition is the consummate introduction to the Microsoft .NET Framework--the technology of choice for building components on Windows platforms. From its many lessons, tips, and guidelines, readers will learn how to use the .NET Framework to program reusable, maintainable, and robust components. Following in the footsteps of its best-selling predecessor, Programming .NET Components, Second Edition has been updated to cover .NET 2.0. It remains one of the few practical books available on this topic. This invaluable resource is targeted at anyone who develops complex or enterprise-level applications with the .NET platform--an ever-widening market. In fact, nearly two million Microsoft developers worldwide now work on such systems. Programming .NET Components, Second Edition begins with a look at the fundamentals of component-oriented programming and then progresses from there. It takes the time to carefully examine how components can simplify and add flexibility to complex applications by allowing users to extend their capabilities. Next, the book introduces a variety of .NET essentials, as well as .NET development techniques. Within this discussion on component development, a separate chapter is devoted to each critical development feature, including asynchronous calls, serialization, remoting, security, and more.

#!A practical guide for comparing, designing, and deploying IPsec, MPLS Layer 3, L2TPv3, L2TPv2, AToM, and SSL virtual private networks Explore the major VPN technologies and their applications, design, and configurations on the Cisco IOS® Router, Cisco® ASA 5500 Series, and the Cisco VPN 3000 Series Concentrator platforms Compare the various VPN protocols and technologies, learn their advantages and disadvantages, and understand their real-world applications and methods of integration Find out how to design and implement Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPNs, including consideration of clientless operation, the Cisco SSL VPN Client, the Cisco Secure Desktop, file and web server access, e-mail proxies, and port forwarding Learn how to deploy scalable and secure IPsec and L2TP remote access VPN designs, including consideration of authentication, encryption, split-tunneling, high availability, load-balancing, and NAT transparency Master scalable IPsec site-to-site VPN design and implementation including configuration of security protocols and policies, multiprotocol/ multicast traffic transport, NAT/PAT traversal, quality of service (QoS), Dynamic Multipoint VPNs (DMVPNs), and public key infrastructure (PKI)Virtual private networks (VPNs) enable organizations to connect offices or other sites over the Internet or a service provider network and allow mobile or home-based users to enjoy the same level of productivity as those who are in the same physical location as the central network. However, with so many flavors of VPNs available, companies and providers are often hard pressed to identify, design, and deploy the VPN solutions that are most appropriate for their particular network architecture and service needs.Comparing, Designing, and Deploying VPNs brings together the most popular VPN technologies for convenient reference. The book examines the real-world operation, application, design, and configuration of the following site-to-site VPNs: Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3)-based Layer 2 VPNs (L2VPN); Any Transport over MPLS (AToM)-based L2VPN; MPLS Layer 3-based VPNs; and IP Security (IPsec)-based VPNs. The book covers the same details for the following remote access VPNs: Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 2 (L2TPv2) VPNs; L2TPv3 VPNs; IPsec-based VPNs; and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) VPNs. Through the operation, application, and configuration details offered in each chapter, you'll learn how to compare and contrast the numerous types of VPN technologies, enabling you to consider all relevant VPN deployment options and select the VPN technologies that are most appropriate for your network.Comparing, Designing, and Deploying VPNs begins with an introduction of the types of VPNs available. Subsequent chapters begin with an overview of the technology, followed by an examination of deployment pros and cons that you can use to determine if the particular VPN technology is appropriate for your network. Detailed discussion of design, deployment, and configuration make up the heart of each chapter. Appendix A offers insight into two multipoint emulated LAN services that can be deployed over a MAN or WAN: Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and IP-only Private LAN Service (IPLS).If you are a network architect, network engineer, network administrator, an IT manager, or CIO involved in selecting, designing, deploying, and supporting VPNs, you'll find Comparing, Designing, and Deploying VPNs to be an indispensable reference.This book is part of the Cisco Press® Networking Technology Series, which offers networking professionals valuable information for constructing efficient networks, understanding new technologies, and building successful careers.

#!Most existing reliable multicast congestion control (RMCC) mechanisms try to emulate TCP congestion control behaviors for achieving TCP-compatibility. However, different loss recovery mechanisms employed in reliable multicast protocols, especially NAK-based retransmission and local loss recovery mechanisms, may lead to different behaviors and performance of congestion control. As a result, reliable multicast flows might be identified and treated as non-TCP-friendly by routers in the network. It is essential to understand those influences and take them into account in the development and deployment of reliable multicast services. In this paper, we study the influences comprehensively through analysis, modelling and simulations. We demonstrate that NAK-based retransmission and/or local loss recovery mechanisms are much more robust and efficient in recovering from single or multiple packet losses within a single round-trip time (RTT). For a better understanding on the impact of loss recovery on RMCC, we derive expressions for steady-state throughput of NAK-based RMCC schemes, which clearly brings out the throughput advantages of NAK-based RMCC over TCP Reno. We also show that timeout effects have little impact on shaping the performance of NAK-based RMCC schemes except for extremely high loss rates (>0.2). Finally, we use simulations to validate our findings and show that local loss recovery may further increase the throughput and deteriorate the fairness properties of NAK-based RMCC schemes. These findings and insights could provide useful recommendations for the design, testing and deployment of reliable multicast protocols and services.

#!The article describes a computational model for the simulation of the emergence of social structure or social order, respectively. The model is theoretically based on the theory of social typifying by Berger and Luckmann. It consists of interacting artificial actors (agents), which are represented by two neural networks, an action net, and a perception net. By mutually adjusting of their actions, the agents are able to constitute a self-organized social order in dependency of their personal characteristics and certain features of their environment. A fictitious example demonstrates the applicability of the model to problems of extra-terrestrial robotics. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!We propose a new construct, the Text-Graphics Character (TGC) CAPTCHA, for preventing dictionary attacks against password authentication systems allowing remote access via dumb terminals. Password authentication is commonly used for computer access control. But password authentication systems are prone to dictionary attacks, in which attackers repeatedly attempt to gain access using the entries in a list of frequently-used passwords. CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are currently being used to prevent automated "bots" from registering for email accounts. They have also been suggested as a means for preventing dictionary attacks. However, current CAPTCHAs are unsuitable for text-based remote access. TGC CAPTCHAs fill this gap. In this paper, we define two TGC CAPTCHAs and incorporate one of them in a prototype based on the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol suite. We also prove that, if a TGC CAPTCHA is easy for humans and hard for machines, then the resulting CAPTCHA is secure. We provide empirical evidence that our TGC CAPTCHAs are indeed easy for humans and hard for machines through a series of experiments. We believe that a system exploiting a TGC CAPTCHA will not only help improve the security of servers allowing remote terminal access, but also encourage a healthy spirit of competition in the fields of pattern recognition, computer graphics, and psychology.

#!Outpatient surgery scheduling involves the coordination of several activities in an uncertain environment. Due to the very customized nature of surgical procedures there is significant uncertainty in the duration of activities related to the intake process, surgical procedure, and recovery process. Furthermore, there are multiple criteria which must be traded off when considering how to schedule surgical procedures including patient waiting, operating room (OR) team waiting, OR idling, and overtime for the surgical suite. Uncertainty combined with the need to tradeoff many criteria makes scheduling a complex task for OR managers. In this article we present a simulation model for a multiple OR surgical suite, describe some of the scheduling challenges, and illustrate how the model can be used as a decisions aid to improve strategic and operational decision making relating to the delivery of surgical services. All results presented are based on real data collected at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

#!In this paper we obtain new results concerning the expected response time of the foreground-background (FB) scheduling discipline and its comparison with processor sharing (PS). Some results previously derived for job sizes with finite second moment or bounded sizes, are extended to infinite second moments. New bounds and asymptotic results are also derived. We show that for job sizes with infinite second moment large jobs may benefit from the FB scheduling discipline although this discipline favors short jobs. For certain distributions all jobs sizes may even benefit from FB with respect to PS showing that the performance benefits obtained by some job sizes need not be obtained at the expense of others.

#!Fortran software is developed that calculates a best piecewise monotonic approximation to n univariate data contaminated by random errors. The underlying method minimizes the weighted sum of the squares of the errors by requiring k &minus; 1 sign changes in the first divided differences of the approximation, where k is a given positive integer. Hence, the piecewise linear interpolant to the fit consists of k monotonic sections, alternately increasing and decreasing. This calculation can have about O(nk) local minima, because the positions of the turning points of the fit are integer variables of the problem. The method, however, by employing a dynamic programming technique divides the data into at most k disjoint sets of adjacent data and solves a k &equals; 1 problem (monotonic fit or isotonic regression) for each set. So it calculates efficiently a global solution in only O(n&sigma; &plus; k&sigma;2) computer operations when k &ge; 3, where &sigma; is the number of local minima of the data, always bounded by n/2. This complexity reduces to only O(n) when k &equals; 1 or k &equals; 2 (unimodal case). At the end of the calculation a spline representation of the solution and the corresponding Lagrange multipliers are provided. The software package has been tested on a variety of data sets showing a performance that does provide in practice shorter computation times than the complexity indicates in theory. An application of the method on identifying turning points and monotonic trends of data from 1947--1996 on the U.K. pound over the U.S. dollar exchange rate is presented. Generally, the method may have useful applications as, for example, in estimating the turning points of a function from some noisy measurements of its values, or in image and signal processing, or in providing a preliminary or complementary smoothing phase to further analyses of the data.

#!Standards and standardized data representation to allow efficient exchange of information is an important topic within systems biology. Within this area there is currently a rapid development of new standards as well as a need for import of datasets into various computer tools for further analysis. As the number of available standards within systems biology is large, tools for comparison and translation of standards are of high interest. In this paper we present a method for comparison of standards. We illustrate how the method works by providing an analysis of the three standards SBML, PSI MI and BioPAX. The analysis gives information on how similar the three standards are and it also gives pointers on how to build tools to aid a user in the analysis of a standard.

#!This paper examines the overhead associated with the IEEE Std 802.15.3 medium access control (MAC) protocol when used in conjunction with Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) radio technology. Particular features of the protocol examined include establishing, modifying and terminating data streams. The main focus of the paper is to investigate the overhead introduced in terms of energy consumption to manage the communication links. One of the main UWB technology candidates, Impulse-Radio (IR-UWB), utilizes very short time domain pulses which are low power and difficult to detect. This raises the question of how to design an efficient MAC protocol to harness the potential of the physical layer (PHY). For high data rate WPAN applications, the IEEE Std 802.15.3 protocol has been proposed as a suitable MAC. In the simulations the data source rate and the number of devices in the network are varied and the considerable overhead produced by command frames is observed.

#!Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received considerable attention for their promising applications in diverse realms. Remote reprogrammability is an obvious need when access to deployed nodes is impossible. The main requirements of remote reprogramming mechanisms are: (i) energy and bandwidth efficiency, (ii) low latency, and (iii) security and reliability. These requirements also apply to mobile computing environments with reprogramming needs. For example, context-aware mobile devices in smart spaces may need to download modules dynamically, depending on services available in a given setting. Existing methods update software either through high level application scripts interpreted by suitable middleware [3], or perform true updates at the binary level [4]. The former approach allows efficient updates through the smaller code capsules afforded by the high level of abstraction. However, this approach lacks flexibility because the middleware cannot be updated. The latter approach solves this problem, but binary updates can be large, leading to costly updates in terms of energy and bandwidth requirements. This poster presents our experiences with a technique [1] to provide flexible low-cost updates, and discusses various research issues we are focusing on to enable its use within a framework for software evolution in WSNs.

#!Password-based authenticated key exchange protocols are more convenient and practical, since users employ human-memorable passwords that are simpler to remember than cryptographic secret keys or public/private keys. Abdalla, Fouque, and Pointcheval proposed the password-based authenticated key exchange protocol in a 3-party model (GPAKE) in which clients trying to establish a secret do not share a password between themselves but only with a trusted server. On the other hand, Canetti presented a general framework, which is called universally composable (UC) framework, for representing cryptographic protocols and analyzing their security. In this framework, the security of protocols is maintained under a general protocol composition operation called universal composition. Canetti also proved a UC composition theorem, which states that the definition of UC-security achieves the goal of concurrent general composition. A server must manage all the passwords of clients when the 3-party password-based authenticated key exchange protocols are realized in large-scale networks. In order to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical hybrid authenticated key exchange protocol (H2AKE). In H2AKE, forwarding servers are located between each client and a distribution server, and the distribution server sends the client an authentication key via the forwarding servers. In H2AKE, public/private keys are used between servers, while passwords are also used between clients and forwarding servers. Thus, in H2AKE, the load on the distribution server can be distributed to the forwarding servers concerning password management. In this paper, we define hierarchical hybrid authenticated key exchange functionality. H2AKE is the universal form of the hierarchical (hybrid) authenticated key exchange protocol, which includes a 3-party model, and it has the characteristic that the construction of the protocol can flexibly change according to the situation. We also prove that H2AKE is secure in the UC framework with the security-preserving composition property.

#!The environment of this study is modelled after a distribution centre in Taiwan. One unique characteristic of this environment is that the picking area has been divided into different zones. A picker often has to visit more than one zone to pick all the items in an order. This environment has one important restriction - no more than one picker can simultaneously be in the same zone. This paper focuses on one problem of this environment, i.e. finding the best zone-visitation sequence a picker can follow. Two zone-visitation sequencing strategies - the fixed zone-visitation sequencing strategy and the dynamic zone-visitation sequencing strategy - are proposed and studied for the problem. Both strategies incorporate a two-phase optimization process. An initial starting solution is found using a nearest-neighbour type generative algorithm NPZF, then a simulated annealing improvement algorithm SA brings this solution towards optimality. This ensures that each strategy is represented by good exemplars of their class. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies in three performance measures - total travel distance of pickers (TTD), total required system Time to complete the picking operations (TRST), and total picking time of pickers (TPT). The simulation results show that the fixed strategy is about 20.9% better than the dynamic strategy in TTD, but about 17% less effective than the dynamic strategy in TRST and TPT. This indicates that the dynamic strategy will be a better strategy if one can prevent the possible physical fatigue experienced by pickers due to the greater travel distance.

#!One-dimensional problems arise in both primal and dual signomial programs. Primal problems are of interest since many multidimensional search procedures involve one-dimensional searches. Dual problems occur naturally since many engineering design problems can be expressed as signomial programs with a single degree of difficulty. This paper applies an interval arithmetic version of Newton's method to one-dimensional unconstrained problems in signomial programming. The interval arithmetic method is guaranteed to generate all the stationary points. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright © 2010 ACM, Inc.

#!A glass float line begins as a continuous process, liquid glass in a furnace, being pulled down a cooling conveyor in a continuous ribbon of glass. The process then becomes discrete as the ribbon is scored and broken into individual streams. Using some insight, a simulation model is developed that is strictly discrete. Four applications of the model are presented. The first demonstrates how the model assists with the day to day operation of the float line. A second application looks at modifying the control rules which sequence and schedule the glass production. The final two applications show how the model is used to study design alternatives for a future float line.

#*Does computer confidence relate to levels of achievement in ICT-enriched learning models?
#@P. Cretchley
#t2007
#cEducation and Information Technologies
#index9937
#!Employer expectations have changed: university students are expected to graduate with computer competencies appropriate for their field. Educators are also harnessing technology as a medium for learning in the belief that information and communication technologies (ICT's) can enliven and motivate learning across a wide range of disciplines. Alongside developing students' computer skills and introducing them to the use of professional software, educators are also harnessing professional and scientific packages for learning in some disciplines. As the educational use of information and communication technologies increases dramatically, questions arise about the effects on learners. While the use of computers for delivery, support, and communication, is generally easy and unthreatening, higher-level use may pose a barrier to learning for those who lack confidence or experience. Computer confidence may mediate in how well students perform in learning environments that require interaction with computers. This paper examines the role played by computer confidence (or computer self-efficacy) in a technology-enriched science and engineering mathematics course in an Australian university. Findings revealed that careful and appropriate use of professional software did indeed enliven learning for the majority of students. However, computer confidence occupied a very different dimension to mathematics confidence: and was not a predictor of achievement in the mathematics tasks, not even those requiring use of technology. Moreover, despite careful and nurturing support for use of the software, students with low computer confidence levels felt threatened and disadvantaged by computer laboratory tasks. The educational implications of these findings are discussed with regard to teaching and assessment, in particular. The TCAT scales used to measure technology attitudes, computer confidence/self-efficacy and mathematics confidence are included in an Appendix. Well-established, reliable, internally consistent, they may be useful to other researchers. The development of the computer confidence scale is outlined, and guidelines are offered for the design of other discipline-specific confidence/self-efficacy scales appropriate for use alongside the computer confidence scale.

#!This paper describes one aspect of our approach in developing an intelligent off-road autonomous vehicle, the Intelligent Off-Road Navigator (ION), as Team Desert Buckeyes from the Ohio State University for the DARPA Grand Challenge 2005. The real-time navigation is one of the critical components in an autonomous ground vehicle system. In this paper, we focus on the navigation module, whose main responsibility is to generate smooth and obstacle-free local paths with appropriate speed setpoints. For the smooth path generation, we introduce a polynomial interpolation method. To generate obstacle-free paths, a steering controller utilizing a fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithm is presented. A speed fuzzy controller is introduced to generate the speed setpoints. These two fuzzy controllers collaborate with each other to guide our vehicle ION to the goal safely. The obstacle avoidance algorithm proposed in this paper was also tested in simulations and on small robots successfully. Other issues related to the navigation module are discussed in the paper as well, such as the vehicle's system structure and its finite state machine. As a result, ION achieved great performance in the National Qualification Event, covered about 30 miles in the Nevada Desert with complete autonomous operations, and finished 10th in the Grand Challenge 2005. &copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#*Two-Band Excitation for HMM-Based Speech Synthesis
#@Sang-Jin Kim,Minsoo Hahn

#!This letter describes a two-band excitation model for HMM-based speech synthesis. The HMM-based speech synthesis system generates speech from the HMM training data of the spectral and excitation parameters. Synthesized speech has a typical quality of "vocoded sound" mostly because of the simple excitation model with the voiced/unvoiced selection. In this letter, two-band excitation based on the harmonic plus noise speech model is proposed for generating the mixed excitation source. With this model, we can generate the mixed excitation more accurately and reduce the memory for the trained excitation data as well.

#!In this paper we solve two open problems in the theory of reduction graphs in lambda calculus. The first question is whether the condensed reduction graph of a lambda term is always locally finite (conjecture of M.Venturini Zilli 1984). We give a negative answer to the conjecture by providing a counterexample. The second problem is whether there is a term such that its reduction graph is composed of two reduction cycles (not loops) intersecting in just one point (problem of J.W.Klop 1980). We show that such a term cannot exist.
